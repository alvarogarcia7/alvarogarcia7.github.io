      <title>Validating CSV data in clojure</title>

      <description>At a client, we have CSVs of data that can be simplified to this 1:
(def data [ [&amp;#34;total&amp;#34; 6 8 13] [&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; 1 2 3] [&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; 2 0 4] [&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; 3 0 6] ]) In this case, some of the row named total is the sum of the rest of the rows, but only for some columns (second and fourth). We do not want to get rid of the columns, as they need to be printed at the end.</description>

      <description>At a client, we were testing a simple feature, but the resulting tests had much subtle repetition:
(source code is here)
@Test public void log_when_sending_greeting_letters() { sut.send(mock(GreetingLetter.class)); verify(logger).sentGreetingLetter(); } @Test public void log_when_sending_love_letters() { sut.send(mock(LoveLetter.class)); verify(logger).sentLoveLetter(); } and the production code:
public class MailSender { private final EventLogger eventLogger; public MailSender (final EventLogger eventLogger) { this.eventLogger = eventLogger; } public void send (final GreetingLetter letter) { // more business logic 	eventLogger.</description>
