      <description>Call me maybe: RabbitMQ I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by Kyle Kingsbury on using RabbitMQ as a lock service. It investigates and gives a counterexample of using it for this purpose.
Uses Knossos to do the testing and surfaces a problem with it. Explains specific problems on locking: at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery
Note: References Jepsen (I guess an inside joke to the song &amp;ldquo;Call me maybe&amp;rdquo; by Carly Rae Jepsen) for at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery.</description>

      <description>Note: all quotes on this post come from this paper: Strachey, C. Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages. Published in Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation, 13, 11–49, 2000.
Contents This paper starts slow, from the mathematical and philosophical point of view, until it gets to the basic concepts on the fundamental concepts:
 Assignment command L-Value and R-Value Definitions Names Numerals Conceptual models: an explanation about the relationship between the code, the memory store and the abstract concepts  Later, it gets more in depth to the conceptual constructs, where most of the content is explained and contains:</description>

      <title>Redesign as a new TDD phase</title>

      <description>In the last TDD workshop (experience report here), a conversation with Gary McLean Hall introduced to me this new concept of &amp;ldquo;Redesign&amp;rdquo; as a TDD phase.
Concept As Gary introduced it to me1, it is a phase that might appear after refactor.
It is about changing the outside design without changing the expected behavior. I thought this was also included in the refactor phase.
How I do redesign I usually do this &amp;ldquo;changing of the outside design&amp;rdquo; by applying a series of refactors 2 to the production code but not changing the test code; using a bridge / adapter to get to the new API from the old one.</description>
