      <description>From the Chapter 3, Managing Dependencies, from the book Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby, by Sandi Metz:

 The name of another class. [&amp;hellip;] The name of a message that it intends to send to someone other than self. [&amp;hellip;] The arguments that a message requires. [&amp;hellip;] The order of those arguments. [&amp;hellip;]   If an object knows any of these facts about another object, it has dependencies to the other.</description>

The idea of easy is too broad; you need concrete definitions of easiness and specific criteria by which to judge code. If you define easy to change as</description>
