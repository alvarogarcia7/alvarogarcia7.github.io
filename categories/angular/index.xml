      <description>At a client, today I&amp;rsquo;ve done an internal training on angular js: we&amp;rsquo;ve prepared some slides and a live demo.
The repository with all the information can be found here.
Apparently, the training has been a success, given that most of the talent in the team is backend focused (as opposed to full-stack) and changing from java to javascript is not straight-forward.
Note: this post has been created a posteriori, dated with the correct training timestamp.</description>
