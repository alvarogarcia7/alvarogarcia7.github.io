      <description>After reading this blog post, here are my thoughts:
WARNING: the post was about how to do it, these reflections are on a more philosophical level
This is a controversial topic, as:
 You cannot discern how much or little the other person knows more than you. I cannot find the reference anymore, but it was a to the tune of &amp;ldquo;once the other person&amp;rsquo;s level is higher than yours, you cannot know how much&amp;rdquo; There are different knowledge areas.</description>
