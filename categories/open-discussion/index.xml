      <description>This week we had a great discussion about Behavior Driven Development (BDD). We have explained it as a way of developing software based on requirements, via automatically tested specifications. For more information, see the wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s article on the subject
I forgot to mention that this is the perfect start to TDD, as this is usually called the double-loop TDD. See a post on it on coding is like cooking
In this double-loop TDD, the first thing is to create a BDD scenario, run it (red-1), create a unit test that reflects this red (red-2), pass it, refactor; go to red-1 as many times as you need, doing TDD cycles.</description>

      <description>At a client, I organized an open discussion on code reviews. We had a great conversation.
The main idea was to discuss about it and share the ideas each one had. I didn&amp;rsquo;t want it to turn into a masterclass (see the white belt)
Benefits These are the main benefits we saw in it:
 Increased trust Learning from others, other approaches Less defects, more quality Increased bus factor, decreased information silos Also:  Getting out of your comfort zone Communicating more often (code style, edge cases, complaining, etc)    Pair programming Then we discussed about the topic of code reviews and pair programming:</description>
