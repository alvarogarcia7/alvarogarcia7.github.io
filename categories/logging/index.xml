      <description>At a client, we&amp;rsquo;re facing this challenge: we cannot access production logs, as we don&amp;rsquo;t have access to production environments. The solution we&amp;rsquo;ve chose is to implement the logging component as a layer on top of Splunk.
This formatter layer &amp;ndash;per component&amp;ndash; accesses a generic layer &amp;ndash;for the whole company&amp;ndash; that accesses splunk. In this manner, it is very easy to reuse the splunk connection and configuration and inject mocks. Also helps with the local environment: you always log to console (even if in production you don&amp;rsquo;t have access to it) and can disable this in local, not needing a local splunk installation.</description>
