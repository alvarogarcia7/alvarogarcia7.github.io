      <description>Translation from Haskell to JavaScript of selected portions of the best introduction to monads I’ve ever read I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by James Coglan, introducing monads.
About composability:
 The symmetry of the argument and return types is what makes these functions composable
 or
 symmetric input and output types
 Guide to basic monadic functions:
 lift, which converts a &amp;lsquo;simple’ function into a debuggable function bind, which converts a debuggable function into a composable form unit, which converts a simple value into the format required for debugging, by placing it in a container</description>

      <description>In his book Working effectively with legacy code, Michael Feathers describes:
 [&amp;hellip;] legacy code as code without tests. It is a good working definition, and it points to a solution [&amp;hellip;]
M Feathers, in the preface of Working effectively with legacy code
 I really like this definition. It is objective and measurable. But this is also a downside. Let&amp;rsquo;s take any concurrent code, for example: you can achieve 100% coverage on a single thread and the program could have defects when executed in parallel.</description>
