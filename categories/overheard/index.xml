      <description>When I went to the Jason Gorman&amp;rsquo;s TDD workshop (experience report here), he said something interesting regarding refactor and TDD:
 In job offers / advertisements, TDD is much more in demand than refactor. But the latter is included in the former as an integral part.
Jason Gorman
 I agree with the second thought: you cannot properly do TDD without refactoring, as it is an integral part; also the third phase.</description>
