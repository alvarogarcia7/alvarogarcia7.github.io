      <title>Validating CSV data in clojure</title>
      <link>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/12/15/validating-data-clojure/</link>

      <description>At a client, we have CSVs of data that can be simplified to this 1:
(def data [ [&amp;#34;total&amp;#34; 6 8 13] [&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; 1 2 3] [&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; 2 0 4] [&amp;#34;0&amp;#34; 3 0 6] ]) In this case, some of the row named total is the sum of the rest of the rows, but only for some columns (second and fourth). We do not want to get rid of the columns, as they need to be printed at the end.</description>

      <description>Call me maybe: RabbitMQ I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by Kyle Kingsbury on using RabbitMQ as a lock service. It investigates and gives a counterexample of using it for this purpose.
Uses Knossos to do the testing and surfaces a problem with it. Explains specific problems on locking: at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery
Note: References Jepsen (I guess an inside joke to the song &amp;ldquo;Call me maybe&amp;rdquo; by Carly Rae Jepsen) for at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery.</description>
