      <description>At the Craft Conf 2015 I saw someone with the book Apprenticeship Patterns by Dave Hoover and Adewale Oshineye and asked them about the book. After praising the contents, they asked me how to approach the book.
I recalled reading it non-sequentially, and explained it to them:
 Read the introduction, preface, etc first When you get to the patterns, pick one at random 10: Read it and navigate through the see also.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading the Apprenticeship patterns book, out of order (explained here: TODO).
I&amp;rsquo;m writing down the read chapters in a text file, to measure progress and also be able to backtrack if necessary. This also makes reading the book a &amp;ldquo;choose your own adventure&amp;rdquo;
After reading approximately half the chapters, the navigation wasn&amp;rsquo;t so easy using only the &amp;ldquo;see also&amp;rdquo; part. So I decided to break free from that constraint and start reading other chapters.</description>

      <description>This was a low-hanging fruit as a team member who specialises in QA complained about testing in the last moment during the last sprint&amp;rsquo;s retrospective.
Did the grunt job of connecting the dots and configuring the maven project (using jbehave). Also, got the inspiration from a tutorial.
Announced it only as it was in place and QA approved of it
This grunt job clicked with Sweep the floor
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how the sprint goes and what are the pain points during this sprint</description>

      <title>Your First Language</title>

      <description>After reading (in a specific order - below) part of the patterns in Apprenticeship Patterns, I stumbled upon the &amp;ldquo;Your First Language&amp;rdquo;
First of all, the illustration with the baby reading a Java book is priceless.
Having said that, I came to the realization that you might not know a paradigm but just an implementation (e.g., you don&amp;rsquo;t know about Object-Oriented programming but just about Java), in the same fashion as you could not know about LISPs but only about an implementation, such as clojure.</description>
