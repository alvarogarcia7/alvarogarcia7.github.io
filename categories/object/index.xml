Software Folklore I&amp;rsquo;ve watched this PechaKucha by Chris Ford on what are laws and how they relate to creating software. Also talks on what could be an analogy to software creation (says not science, not engineering)</description>

      <description>In Ruby, you can query the methods an object accepts:
pry(main)&amp;gt; 1.methods =&amp;gt; [:to_s, :-@, :+, :-, :*, :/, :div, :%, :modulo, :divmod, :fdiv, ... In case you want to call all methods, this can be useful (plus its tests):
def call_all_methods(object, *args) # remove methods that modify the PRY environment or are too verbose success = {} error = {} exclusions = [:pry, :methods, :private_methods, :public_methods, :gem].map { |x| x.</description>

 The name of another class. [&amp;hellip;] The name of a message that it intends to send to someone other than self. [&amp;hellip;] The arguments that a message requires. [&amp;hellip;] The order of those arguments. [&amp;hellip;]   If an object knows any of these facts about another object, it has dependencies to the other.</description>
