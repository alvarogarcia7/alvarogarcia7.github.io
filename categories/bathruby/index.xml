      <description>I have seen this video: [Nothing is something][video] by [Sandi Metz][sandimetz], as I saw it recommended [here][recommendation]
In the video, she talks programming in this fashion: (it is a stack, not an unordered list)
 Abstraction seeking Message centric Condition Averse Smalltalk Infected   Not here to change the language but change you
 This is a pattern I&amp;rsquo;ve also heard from [Alvaro Videla][old_sound], where he said that other, more powerful languages can change your mind and help you bring some of those concepts to your own language.</description>
