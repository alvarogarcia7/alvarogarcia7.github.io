      <description>It is a good practice to push your local work at the end of the day. Be it for increasing the bus factor (more people have the code), be it for reducing the lifespan of the branches (less time without integrating) or just enabling visibility (your teammates to see what has been developed). If you&amp;rsquo;re using Continuous Integration (CI) or Continuous Delivery (CD), this is even more often
You can even do it more often: for example before going to lunch, before a meeting, before a demo, etc.</description>

      <description>A quote from the book The Nature of Software Development by Ron Jeffries, talking about value (in software) and the building blocks to achieve it:
 Value. Value, we’ll see, is “what you want.” [&amp;hellip;]
We’ll tell the story by building up from the bottom of the pyramid, describing how to guide, organize, plan, and build our product, in small slices, with a focus on quality. The value we produce is based on these.</description>

      <description>Advice for white men I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by Cate Huston about how advice affects different people.
 But here are some things to consider:
 Advice on failure is different for people who are judged on performance rather than potential. Advice on saying no is different for people who aren’t appreciated for doing work for the collective… but who are punished if they don’t. Advice on negotiation is different for people who are perceived negatively when they do negotiate.</description>

      <description>Call me maybe: RabbitMQ I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by Kyle Kingsbury on using RabbitMQ as a lock service. It investigates and gives a counterexample of using it for this purpose.
Uses Knossos to do the testing and surfaces a problem with it. Explains specific problems on locking: at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery
Note: References Jepsen (I guess an inside joke to the song &amp;ldquo;Call me maybe&amp;rdquo; by Carly Rae Jepsen) for at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery.</description>

      <description>Overheard today at the office, while they were discussing the approval of a pull request:
 [Pull request reviewer] - I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, can&amp;rsquo;t approve this: I don&amp;rsquo;t really agree with this design. Isn&amp;rsquo;t there an alternative for this?
[Pull request author] - [redacted], of course you don&amp;rsquo;t, you&amp;rsquo;re the guardian of the source
[PR reviewer] - Well, sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m a bit picky about introducing bad code into our codebase.
 This has made me think about Gandalf blocking the path of Balrog Demon, shouting &amp;ldquo;[you shall not pass][you-shall-not-pass-meme]&amp;rdquo; while on top of the bridge.</description>
