      <description>With my pairing mate we have refactored this piece of functional code.
Original code:
function filterTokens (rawTokens) { const cleanedTokens = rawTokens.map(token =&amp;gt; (token.length &amp;amp;&amp;amp; token[0] === &amp;#39;-&amp;#39;) ? token.substring(1) : token) return cleanedTokens.filter(token =&amp;gt; token !== &amp;#39;&amp;#39; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; stopWordsArray.indexOf(token) === -1) } Refactored code:
function filterTokens (rawTokens) { const cleanedTokens = rawTokens.map(token =&amp;gt; startsWithADash(token) ? removeDashFrom(token) : token) const processedTokens = cleanedTokens.filter(token =&amp;gt; isNotEmpty(token) &amp;amp;&amp;amp; isNotAStopWord(token)) return processedTokens function startsWithADash (token) { return (token.</description>

      <description>Learning Programming Isn’t That Hard, Deep Work Is Hard I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by Benedict Fritz on two types of work (i.e., deep and shallow) and how programming is of the deep type. He links the difficulty of learning to program to the difficulty of practicing deep work.

      <title>What legacy code is about</title>

      <description>In his book Working effectively with legacy code, Michael Feathers describes:
 [&amp;hellip;] legacy code as code without tests. It is a good working definition, and it points to a solution [&amp;hellip;]
M Feathers, in the preface of Working effectively with legacy code
 I really like this definition. It is objective and measurable. But this is also a downside. Let&amp;rsquo;s take any concurrent code, for example: you can achieve 100% coverage on a single thread and the program could have defects when executed in parallel.</description>

      <description>This is one of the best legacy code introductions I&amp;rsquo;ve seen:
 The Grand Redesign in the Sky
Eventually the team rebels. They inform management that they cannot continue to develop in this odious code base. They demand a redesign. Management does not want to expend the resources on a whole new redesign of the project, but they cannot deny that productivity is terrible. Eventually they bend to the demands of the developers and authorize the grand redesign in the sky.</description>
