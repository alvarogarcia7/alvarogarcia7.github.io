      <title>Comparing options for parametrized testing in javascript</title>

      <description>We explore how to use parametrized tests (example in java, example in c#)
The tests are written using mocha syntax: describe, it. Using chai for expectations: assert.
Note: the example used below (adding to an array) is simple enough to be understood by everybody, without having to explain the domain. The real tests can have a more complicated environment or domain. This is just an example.
Using a custom syntax This is just an example of some possible syntax, not using any (currently) existing framework.</description>

      <description>Translation from Haskell to JavaScript of selected portions of the best introduction to monads I’ve ever read I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by James Coglan, introducing monads.
About composability:
 The symmetry of the argument and return types is what makes these functions composable
 or
 symmetric input and output types
 Guide to basic monadic functions:
 lift, which converts a &amp;lsquo;simple’ function into a debuggable function bind, which converts a debuggable function into a composable form unit, which converts a simple value into the format required for debugging, by placing it in a container</description>

      <description>In Working effectively with legacy code, Michael Feathers talks a type of tests to define or characterize the current behavior of the legacy system:
 In nearly every legacy system, what the system does is more important than what it is supposed to do.
A characterization test is a test that characterizes the actual behavior of a piece of code. [&amp;hellip;] The test document the actual current behavior of the system.</description>

      <description>There are times when you only want to have the production code:
 downstream job after a successful build compiling in local after checkout from DVCS spiking (possibly the tests are broken) speeding up the process  For that, maven allows to skip the tests, selectively:
 -DskipTests compiles the tests, but skips running them -Dmaven.test.skip skips compiling the tests and does not run them. This can also be written as -Dmaven.</description>
