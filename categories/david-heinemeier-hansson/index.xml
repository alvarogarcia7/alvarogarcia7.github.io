      <description>Advice for white men I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by Cate Huston about how advice affects different people.

Advice on saying no is different for people who aren’t appreciated for doing work for the collective… but who are punished if they don’t. Advice on negotiation is different for people who are perceived negatively when they do negotiate.</description>
