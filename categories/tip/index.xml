      <description>After writing more and more bash scripts for a client, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write down my thoughts about it.
This assumes you have some knowledge about bash, as it is not intended as a beginner&amp;rsquo;s tutorial.
Why bash scripts?  Bash is present in almost every unix/linux-based stack, now some Windows as well. An exception is the &amp;lsquo;alpine&amp;rsquo; docker images, which have a smaller, lighter shell (more on that later) Everything that you can automate, you can do from bash.</description>

      <guid>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2016/02/14/two-persons-involved-in-a-git-commit/</guid>
      <description>On git You can have multiple persons involved in a single git commit: an author and a committer.
The difference is explained by Manuel Doninger 1:
 The author is the one who did the code change. The committer is the person who committed that change to a repository.
 an example, by the same author:
 Example: I&amp;rsquo;m not a committer in the EGit project, so i have no rights to push directly to the EGit repository at Eclipse.</description>

      <description>There are times when you only want to have the production code:
 downstream job after a successful build compiling in local after checkout from DVCS spiking (possibly the tests are broken) speeding up the process  For that, maven allows to skip the tests, selectively:
 -DskipTests compiles the tests, but skips running them -Dmaven.test.skip skips compiling the tests and does not run them. This can also be written as -Dmaven.</description>

      <description>In bash, the usual behavior is to return the last status code:
bash-3.1$ tr tr: two strings must be given when translating bash-3.1$ echo $? 1 But this also applies to pipes:
bash-3.1$ tr|tee 1.txt tr: two strings must be given when translating bash-3.1$ echo $? 0 Should you want to pass the non-zero (error) status code to the next operation, use this feature toggle: set -o pipefail
bash-3.1$ set -o pipefail bash-3.</description>

      <title>Searching on a suite of failing tests</title>

      <description>Motivation Today, at a client, in the green phase, we had a test suite which was failing: the whole suite fails but the test cases, individually, succeed.
So my first impression was that something was being shared between tests. Also confirmed because the failing class was an EndToEnd test, in which we load the whole spring context
A quick glance was not revealing anything interesting, so I decided to find which is the minimum suite (as opposed as to the whole suite) that makes the new testcase fail, expecting to narrow the search for possible causes.</description>

      <guid>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/07/08/tip-massively-reverting-local-changes/</guid>
      <description>I was changing a massive amount of files (&amp;gt;1000) for a repeated code. The search and replace query was not too exact and it broke many tests in the system. For that, I preferred reverting those tests.
Here&amp;rsquo;s how to do it automatically:
Copy all the failing tests to a text editor:
Input:
testSearchXMLDocument(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) testCreateXMLDocument(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) testUpdateXFPageMetadata(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) testCreateDocumentCrop(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) testUpdateCropMetadata(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) testDeleteDocument(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) testUpdateXmlDocumentMetadata(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) testUpdateXML(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) testSearchXFPage(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) testCreateXFPage(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) testUpdatePage(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) testSearchCrop(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) testUpdateCrop(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) testMoveDocument(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) testGetDocument(io.company.controller.dms.DocumentControllerTest) regex:

      <description>I was prefer committing to the repo with commits that are as small as possible as long as it makes sense. It makes it much easier to rever the changes.
This is why I have some scripts to commit all the changes, even with the same message. This is one of them:
for f in $(git status -s |grep &amp;#34;^M&amp;#34;|awk &amp;#39;{print $2}&amp;#39;); do git add $f git commit -m &amp;#34;generic commit for all files&amp;#34; done </description>
