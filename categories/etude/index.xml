      <description>We explore how to use parametrized tests (example in java, example in c#)
The tests are written using mocha syntax: describe, it. Using chai for expectations: assert.
Note: the example used below (adding to an array) is simple enough to be understood by everybody, without having to explain the domain. The real tests can have a more complicated environment or domain. This is just an example.
Using a custom syntax This is just an example of some possible syntax, not using any (currently) existing framework.</description>
