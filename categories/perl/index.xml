      <description>After writing more and more bash scripts for a client, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write down my thoughts about it.
This assumes you have some knowledge about bash, as it is not intended as a beginner&amp;rsquo;s tutorial.
Why bash scripts?  Bash is present in almost every unix/linux-based stack, now some Windows as well. An exception is the &amp;lsquo;alpine&amp;rsquo; docker images, which have a smaller, lighter shell (more on that later) Everything that you can automate, you can do from bash.</description>
