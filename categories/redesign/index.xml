      <description>In the last TDD workshop (experience report here), a conversation with Gary McLean Hall introduced to me this new concept of &amp;ldquo;Redesign&amp;rdquo; as a TDD phase.
Concept As Gary introduced it to me1, it is a phase that might appear after refactor.
It is about changing the outside design without changing the expected behavior. I thought this was also included in the refactor phase.
How I do redesign I usually do this &amp;ldquo;changing of the outside design&amp;rdquo; by applying a series of refactors 2 to the production code but not changing the test code; using a bridge / adapter to get to the new API from the old one.</description>
