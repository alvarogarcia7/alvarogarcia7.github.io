      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m currently reading the Apprenticeship patterns book, out of order (explained here: TODO).
I&amp;rsquo;m writing down the read chapters in a text file, to measure progress and also be able to backtrack if necessary. This also makes reading the book a &amp;ldquo;choose your own adventure&amp;rdquo;
After reading approximately half the chapters, the navigation wasn&amp;rsquo;t so easy using only the &amp;ldquo;see also&amp;rdquo; part. So I decided to break free from that constraint and start reading other chapters.</description>
