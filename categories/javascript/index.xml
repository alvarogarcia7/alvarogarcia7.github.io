      <description>How I ended up paying $150 for a single 60GB download from Amazon Glacier I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by Marko Karppinen that explains how a mistake in understanding the pricing model of AWS Glacier cost 150$ instead of the expected 0.86$
 When cloud providers use uncommon and/or unpredictable pricing models, even your informed hunch about the cost can be off by several orders of magnitude, like the price differential between an iPad and a Ferrari.</description>

      <guid>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2017/03/03/convert-a-project-from-npm-to-yarn/</guid>
      <description>At a client, we&amp;rsquo;re converting all projects (i.e., sites, services, libraries) from npm to yarn. Mostly for the speed (as it uses the internal cache).
Step by step guide  Install yarn in your local environment * https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/ Run yarn install * This will create a yarn.lock file * Add that file to the repo: git add yarn.lock Modify Dockerfile * Install yarn (in the Dockerfile). Idea: shortcut this execution with yarn --version in case it is installed * Configure the PATH variable (ENV PATH &amp;hellip;) * ADD yarn.</description>

      <guid>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2017/02/26/comparing-options-for-parametrized-testing-in-javascript/</guid>
      <description>We explore how to use parametrized tests (example in java, example in c#)
The tests are written using mocha syntax: describe, it. Using chai for expectations: assert.
Note: the example used below (adding to an array) is simple enough to be understood by everybody, without having to explain the domain. The real tests can have a more complicated environment or domain. This is just an example.
Using a custom syntax This is just an example of some possible syntax, not using any (currently) existing framework.</description>

      <description>Translation from Haskell to JavaScript of selected portions of the best introduction to monads I’ve ever read I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by James Coglan, introducing monads.
About composability:
 The symmetry of the argument and return types is what makes these functions composable
 or
 symmetric input and output types
 Guide to basic monadic functions:
 lift, which converts a &amp;lsquo;simple’ function into a debuggable function bind, which converts a debuggable function into a composable form unit, which converts a simple value into the format required for debugging, by placing it in a container</description>

      <title>A common misunderstanding about `reduce`</title>
      <link>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2016/12/14/a-common-misunderstanding-about-reduce/</link>

      <guid>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2016/12/14/a-common-misunderstanding-about-reduce/</guid>
      <description>Misconception I&amp;rsquo;ve read in several places that reduce reduces an array1 of values to a single one. The main characteristic of this function is not to reduce to a &amp;lsquo;smaller element&amp;rsquo; / &amp;lsquo;single element&amp;rsquo;, but to have access to the accumulated results and the elements, one by one. Quoting Mozilla Developer Network&amp;rsquo;s (MDN) Javascript reference:
 The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value.</description>
