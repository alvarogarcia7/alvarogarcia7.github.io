      <description>&lt;p&gt;A quote from &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.reinventingorganizations.com&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Reinventing Organizations&lt;/a&gt;,
about roles, job descriptions and job titles in Chapter 2.2:
Self-management (structures), page 90:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;[In] Teal Organizations [&amp;hellip;] people are not made to fit pre-defined jobs;
 their job emerge from a multitude of roles and responsibilities they pick
 up based on their interests, talents, and the needs of the organization.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Frederic Laloux, Reinventing Organizations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In my opinion, this is the role of the software consultant when working with a client:
even if the customer has asked for help in some parts of their activity, a senior-enough
consultant can discover other areas where they can add value, even if that new
work doesn&amp;rsquo;t have much in common with the initial request (this change should
be approved by the people that will be affected).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is also a thought that &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/@mashooq&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Mash&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/@sandromancuso&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Sandro&lt;/a&gt; were discussing lately.&lt;/p&gt;
