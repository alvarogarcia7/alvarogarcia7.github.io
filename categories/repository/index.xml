Why I&amp;rsquo;d never work for Google, Twitter, or Facebook I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by David Bryant Copeland on why he would never work for these three companies: he doesn&amp;rsquo;t share the principles and values from these companies.</description>

      <title>Tool: Building a local pipeline</title>
      <link>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/10/10/tool_building_local_pipeline/</link>

      <guid>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/10/10/tool_building_local_pipeline/</guid>
      <description>Motivation At a client, one of the projects has a long building process and the tests are mostly slow, so I use a local building pipeline, an example of the Pipes and Filters pattern.
This allows for executing manually only the fast unit tests, then automatically (no user intervention, no time spent) executing the rest of them before pushing. In case the latter fails, it is possible to do git push -f to the pipeline without corrupting the central repository (origin) history, possibly disturbing others.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve reorganized my github repositories, especially the katas and the simple sessions.
Katas All of them can be found in this search
Separated by language:
 Java Clojure Javascript Haskell Ruby  To the best of my knowledge, all repositories follow a similar pattern:
 Contain the keyword &amp;lsquo;kata&amp;rsquo; Contain the language Contain a description of the exercise  An example: palindromes-searcher-kata-haskell
Simple sessions A simple session is a lapse of time working with the language to solve a problem, but not big enough to deserve a repository of its own.</description>

      <title>Brown-bag session and Dojo: Beginning Clojure</title>
      <link>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/08/05/brown-bag-session-and-dojo-beginning-clojure/</link>

      <guid>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/08/05/brown-bag-session-and-dojo-beginning-clojure/</guid>
      <description>At a client, today I&amp;rsquo;ve facilitated a brown-bag session introducing the Clojure language to a group of java programmers.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started hands-on, live coding on a REPL. To make things easier, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a maven project that imports the clojure jar and lets you obtain dependencies from clojars. The repo is here. This repo wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been possible without the clojure maven plugin, written by Mark Derricutt.
I&amp;rsquo;ve more or less followed this guide</description>

      <title>Maven module Base for cucumber in java</title>
      <link>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/03/10/maven-module-base-for-cucumber-in-java/</link>

      <guid>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/03/10/maven-module-base-for-cucumber-in-java/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve built a small maven module, to be used directly with cucumber. You can fork the repository here
This is the setup I&amp;rsquo;ve proposed for the meetup &amp;ldquo;BDD Cucumber kata (gherkin + code)&amp;quot;. Will see if this code is successfully used by the ~40 participants in a couple of weeks
(Quote from the README.md):
This maven project has been possible due to Thomas Sundberg and this post
Should you want to, there&amp;rsquo;s a tweet to thank him the effort: [tweet intent here](https://twitter.</description>

      <title>Code Snippets Stash</title>
      <link>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/01/24/code-snippets-stash/</link>

      <guid>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/01/24/code-snippets-stash/</guid>
      <description>Following a team member&amp;rsquo;s recommendation, I recently started a repository to save all my useful snippets.
I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that the examples should be designed guided by tests or at least to have a working example exercised by tests. Also, that I should not reinvent the wheel and use as many open source libraries as possible, reducing the amount of code I have to write myself.
Ideally, every snippet should be a maven project (where applicable) and be imported as a small library, therefore being able to reuse the functionality incrementally across projects.</description>
