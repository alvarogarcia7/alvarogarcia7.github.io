      <description>It is a good practice to push your local work at the end of the day. Be it for increasing the bus factor (more people have the code), be it for reducing the lifespan of the branches (less time without integrating) or just enabling visibility (your teammates to see what has been developed). If you&amp;rsquo;re using Continuous Integration (CI) or Continuous Delivery (CD), this is even more often
You can even do it more often: for example before going to lunch, before a meeting, before a demo, etc.</description>
