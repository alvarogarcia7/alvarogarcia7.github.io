      <description>A quote from the Mythical Man-Month:
 Chapter 13: The Whole and the Parts
[&amp;hellip;] In System/360 engineering models, one saw occasional strands of purple wire among the routine yellow wires. When a bug was found, two things were done. A quick fix was devised and installed on the system, so testing could proceed. This change was put on in purple wire, so it stuck out like a sore thumb. It was entered in the log.</description>
