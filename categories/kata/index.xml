      <description>(This formulation has been copied and adapted from Bobby Johnson and Terry Hughes&amp;rsquo;s repository)
Formulation Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods.
Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us.</description>

      <description>Little Johnny is inspecting a PHP source code that contains comments. These comments contains words that he doesn&amp;rsquo;t understand, as it written in another language.
Rules and constraints The source code in the PHP files does not need to be correct.
A comment (a subset of PHP comments) is defined as:
 A line containing C-style comment delimiter, except when it is within a string  // hello C-style is a valid comment echo &amp;quot;//&amp;quot;; is not a comment echo &#39;//&#39;; is not a comment   A line containing Perl-style comment delimiter, except when it is within a string  # hello Perl-style is a valid comment echo &amp;quot;#&amp;quot;; is not a comment echo &#39;#&#39;; is not a comment   There are no multi-line comments  /* .</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve reorganized my github repositories, especially the katas and the simple sessions.
Katas All of them can be found in this search
Separated by language:
 Java Clojure Javascript Haskell Ruby  To the best of my knowledge, all repositories follow a similar pattern:
 Contain the keyword &amp;lsquo;kata&amp;rsquo; Contain the language Contain a description of the exercise  An example: palindromes-searcher-kata-haskell
Simple sessions A simple session is a lapse of time working with the language to solve a problem, but not big enough to deserve a repository of its own.</description>

      <description>Last Friday we did a kata1 using a projector the string calculator 2 using pair programming, TDD and some mob-programming for the last refactoring.
We used a projector (beamer) so everyone could see it. I tried to take really small baby steps but the adding part was done in ~6 cycles3
We&amp;rsquo;ve all learnt about shotcuts, live user templates for the IDE 4, TDD methodology, other ways of tackling the problem, how to refactor as a group, clean code, etc</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve just written a new kata, about a persistent linked list.
It is using the same project as for the linked list kata.
For now, only the add, contains and size methods are implemented.

      <description>Manuel Rivero and I did a subset of the bank kata, proposed by Sandro Mancuso.
We&amp;rsquo;ve used java (mockito, hamcrest, junit), outside-in TDD. The code is spread among several sessions. We have not committed after each step, only at the end of the session.
The source code is on github
You can read Manuel&amp;rsquo;s take on the kata on his blog</description>

      <description>Last year we started the program 12 months, 12 katas (as inspired by this repository). This year we want to propose something different: an asynchronous code jam
##New problem: Mini-Power Swapper
This post belongs to a series: code-jam
Each month (or so) we at GMaur will publish a new problem (and announce it on twitter) and post a solution to the last problem.
This month, the Mini-Power Swapper

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve written a RPN string calculator in java, using TDD with these: mockito, hamcrest, junit
It&amp;rsquo;s close to the String Calculator kata, by Roy Osherove. This RPN is using mocks (so more difficult than the String calculator)
I&amp;rsquo;ve tried to practice &amp;ldquo;Your tests are dragging you down&amp;rdquo; by J.B Rainsberger (mainly, to use something to write on). This behavior is also explained in the book Dirigido por tests (Spanish) by Carlos Blé.</description>
