      <description>This week we had a great discussion about Behavior Driven Development (BDD). We have explained it as a way of developing software based on requirements, via automatically tested specifications. For more information, see the wikipedia&amp;rsquo;s article on the subject
I forgot to mention that this is the perfect start to TDD, as this is usually called the double-loop TDD. See a post on it on coding is like cooking
In this double-loop TDD, the first thing is to create a BDD scenario, run it (red-1), create a unit test that reflects this red (red-2), pass it, refactor; go to red-1 as many times as you need, doing TDD cycles.</description>
