      <description>We can combine the &amp;ldquo;Split loop&amp;rdquo; refactoring technique plus the &amp;ldquo;Loop / Map equivalence&amp;rdquo; when refactoring.
Given that it does not matter in which order we apply these operations, we can say that they have the associative property
Chart of the operations Take the case of a loop doing two things. From there:
 we can replace the loop for a map (including the two actions into a single map body) we can split the loop into two loops  Take the case of two loops, doing one thing each.</description>

      <description>Translation from Haskell to JavaScript of selected portions of the best introduction to monads I’ve ever read I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by James Coglan, introducing monads.
About composability:
 The symmetry of the argument and return types is what makes these functions composable
 or
 symmetric input and output types
 Guide to basic monadic functions:
 lift, which converts a &amp;lsquo;simple’ function into a debuggable function bind, which converts a debuggable function into a composable form unit, which converts a simple value into the format required for debugging, by placing it in a container</description>

      <title>A common misunderstanding about `reduce`</title>
      <link>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2016/12/14/a-common-misunderstanding-about-reduce/</link>

      <description>Misconception I&amp;rsquo;ve read in several places that reduce reduces an array1 of values to a single one. The main characteristic of this function is not to reduce to a &amp;lsquo;smaller element&amp;rsquo; / &amp;lsquo;single element&amp;rsquo;, but to have access to the accumulated results and the elements, one by one. Quoting Mozilla Developer Network&amp;rsquo;s (MDN) Javascript reference:
 The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value.</description>

      <description>Advice for white men I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by Cate Huston about how advice affects different people.
 But here are some things to consider:
 Advice on failure is different for people who are judged on performance rather than potential. Advice on saying no is different for people who aren’t appreciated for doing work for the collective… but who are punished if they don’t. Advice on negotiation is different for people who are perceived negatively when they do negotiate.</description>

      <description>Call me maybe: RabbitMQ I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by Kyle Kingsbury on using RabbitMQ as a lock service. It investigates and gives a counterexample of using it for this purpose.

Note: References Jepsen (I guess an inside joke to the song &amp;ldquo;Call me maybe&amp;rdquo; by Carly Rae Jepsen) for at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery.</description>
