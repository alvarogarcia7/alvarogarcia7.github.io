      <description>As the preface for the guide for on-call support, a positive note:
README  You’re cool. I know it. Do not trust yourself, trust me that I trust you. You might be sleepy. It’s OK Everything is going to be fine. Take 5 minutes to think about anything, anytime. Especially before any rash decision. With great power comes great responsibility. Use it wisely. Restoring the services comes first, investigation comes second Do the very minimum of investigation after the incident (collect things that might disappear), leave the rest for the next day on office hours Whenever everything is done, go to sleep but keep an eye on your phone.</description>
