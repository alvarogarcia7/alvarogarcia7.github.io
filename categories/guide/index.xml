      <title>Writing safe(r) bash scripts</title>

      <description>After writing more and more bash scripts for a client, I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to write down my thoughts about it.
This assumes you have some knowledge about bash, as it is not intended as a beginner&amp;rsquo;s tutorial.
Why bash scripts?  Bash is present in almost every unix/linux-based stack, now some Windows as well. An exception is the &amp;lsquo;alpine&amp;rsquo; docker images, which have a smaller, lighter shell (more on that later) Everything that you can automate, you can do from bash.</description>

      <description>At a client, today I&amp;rsquo;ve facilitated a brown-bag session introducing the Clojure language to a group of java programmers.
I&amp;rsquo;ve started hands-on, live coding on a REPL. To make things easier, I&amp;rsquo;ve created a maven project that imports the clojure jar and lets you obtain dependencies from clojars. The repo is here. This repo wouldn&amp;rsquo;t have been possible without the clojure maven plugin, written by Mark Derricutt.
I&amp;rsquo;ve more or less followed this guide</description>
