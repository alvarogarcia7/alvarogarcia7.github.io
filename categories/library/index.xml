      <description>Work cycles I&amp;rsquo;ve read this Work Cycle framework to be more productive with your daily routine.
Suggests an alternative to Pomodoro technique, in which you are to write down the contents of the goal, then split in small chunks (periods) of time to complete the individual tasks, then debrief at the end of the period and at the end of the cycle.
An analogy could be a double-loop Pomodoro technique for tasks.</description>

private static class RepeatedConstants { public static final String A = &amp;#34;A&amp;#34;; public static final String A_1 = A; public static final String A_2 = &amp;#34;A&amp;#34;; public static final Integer _3 = 3; public static final Integer THREE = 3; } I wanted to remove the repeated values in the constants, in an automatic way, because the file was big (&amp;gt; 4000 constants). A way of doing this is basing the differences on the values, directly.</description>
