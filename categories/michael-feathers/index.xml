      <description>In Working effectively with legacy code, Michael Feathers talks a type of tests to define or characterize the current behavior of the legacy system:
 In nearly every legacy system, what the system does is more important than what it is supposed to do.
A characterization test is a test that characterizes the actual behavior of a piece of code. [&amp;hellip;] The test document the actual current behavior of the system.</description>

      <description>We&amp;rsquo;ve read the first chapter from the Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby, by Sandi Metz.
These are the concepts and links brought up during the discussion:
 Walking on water and developing software from a specification are easy if both are frozen.

      <description>In his book Working effectively with legacy code, Michael Feathers describes:
 [&amp;hellip;] legacy code as code without tests. It is a good working definition, and it points to a solution [&amp;hellip;]
M Feathers, in the preface of Working effectively with legacy code
 I really like this definition. It is objective and measurable. But this is also a downside. Let&amp;rsquo;s take any concurrent code, for example: you can achieve 100% coverage on a single thread and the program could have defects when executed in parallel.</description>
