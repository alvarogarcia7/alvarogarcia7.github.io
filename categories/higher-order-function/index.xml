      <description>Misconception I&amp;rsquo;ve read in several places that reduce reduces an array1 of values to a single one. The main characteristic of this function is not to reduce to a &amp;lsquo;smaller element&amp;rsquo; / &amp;lsquo;single element&amp;rsquo;, but to have access to the accumulated results and the elements, one by one. Quoting Mozilla Developer Network&amp;rsquo;s (MDN) Javascript reference:
 The reduce() method applies a function against an accumulator and each value of the array (from left-to-right) to reduce it to a single value.</description>
