      <description>A quote from the Mythical Man-Month:
 Chapter 13: The Whole and the Parts
[&amp;hellip;] In System/360 engineering models, one saw occasional strands of purple wire among the routine yellow wires. When a bug was found, two things were done. A quick fix was devised and installed on the system, so testing could proceed. This change was put on in purple wire, so it stuck out like a sore thumb. It was entered in the log.</description>

      <description>The toolsmith Frederick P Brooks, Jr quoted / explained a theory explained by Mills and Baker1 around 1971-72:
 Chapter 3: The Surgical Team
[&amp;hellip;] but the team be organized like a surgical team rather than a hog-butchering team. That is, instead of each member cutting away on the problem, one does the cutting and the others give him[her] every support that will enhance his[her] effectiveness and productivity.

      <description>Quoting the book,
 Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?
First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design [&amp;hellip;]
Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want other to use our work and to find it helpful.</description>
