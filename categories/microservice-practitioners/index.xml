## Gerald Weinberg on Bugs, Errors, and Software Quality

I&#39;ve listened to [this interview][bug-error-weinberg] with Gerald Weinberg where he first talks about software quality, defining a fault, failure, a boo-boo, a blunder (below). Then, they move on to the cost of quality, experiences in his project &#39;Mercury&#39; (a man in orbit; his contribution was on the software side). Says it&#39;s one of his first projects where a person&#39;s life was directly related to a piece of software.

Fault: wrong operation in code
Failure: user&#39;s experience caused by a fault
Boo-boo: a one-off, small failure. Usually shrugged as a small defect
Blunder: a one-off, big failure. Can kill a career

About the cost of software, he mentions that many managers are not willing to pay the price of almost defect-free software and that this level of quality is not required in every project. This idea is similar to the one &#39;Testing every part is akin to reading every letter on the newspaper: one parts are more important than other&#39;.

This interview talks about similar topics than &#39;Why programs fail&#39;, especially about the definition.

At the end of the interview, he talks about team-based software development (~XP) and an anecdote about a company he was consulting with: follow the process or pay the defects out of your own pocket. One of them, accepted paying for defects, until he made a big mistake. Accepted training the rest of the employees into his very precise methods and became very valuable to the company.

&lt;h2 id=&#34;bored-people-quit&#34;&gt;Bored People Quit&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve read &lt;a href=&#34;http://randsinrepose.com/archives/bored-people-quit/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this article&lt;/a&gt; by Michael Lopp on what are some mechanisms why bored people quit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Some interesting quotes:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My gig is the care and feeding of engineers, and their productivity is my productivity. If they all leave, I have exactly no job.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My job isnâ€™t just building product; I also build people.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
