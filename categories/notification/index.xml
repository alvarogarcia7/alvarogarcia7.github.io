      <title>Tool: Building a local pipeline</title>
      <link>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/10/10/tool_building_local_pipeline/</link>

      <description>Motivation At a client, one of the projects has a long building process and the tests are mostly slow, so I use a local building pipeline, an example of the Pipes and Filters pattern.
This allows for executing manually only the fast unit tests, then automatically (no user intervention, no time spent) executing the rest of them before pushing. In case the latter fails, it is possible to do git push -f to the pipeline without corrupting the central repository (origin) history, possibly disturbing others.</description>

      <description>A friend and I were arguing about this code (fragment):
public void register (final String userName) { try { registeredUsers.add(new User(userName)); } catch (AlreadyRegisteredUserException e) { resultListener.alreadyRegistered(userName); } } I would have said that resultListener is a dependency as, first, it was injected by the constructor, second, it is necessary for the execution (negative case).
He suggested that:
 being injected through the constructor is usually what happens with dependencies, but does not make it one (i.</description>

      <description>We categorize an object&amp;rsquo;s peers (loosely) into three types of relationship. An object might have:
 Dependencies: Services that the object requires from its peers so it can perform its responsibilities. The object cannot function without these services. It should not be possible to create the object without them. For example, a graphics package will need something like a screen or canvas to draw on&amp;ndash;it doesn&amp;rsquo;t make sense without one.</description>
