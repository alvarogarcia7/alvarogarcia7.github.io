      <description>Note: all quotes on this post come from this paper: Strachey, C. Fundamental Concepts in Programming Languages. Published in Higher-Order and Symbolic Computation, 13, 11–49, 2000.
Contents This paper starts slow, from the mathematical and philosophical point of view, until it gets to the basic concepts on the fundamental concepts:

      <guid>https://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/05/12/paper-tdd-in-industrial-teams/</guid>
      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve read this paper by Nagappan, Maximilien, Bhat and Williams on the cost, advantages, pitfalls of doing TDD in industrial teams (private companies who create software).

  they seem to be talking about inside-out tdd as in chapter 2 (page 291), they talk about small units and then integrating them in a bigger context  Benefits taken from chapter 2 (page 292)</description>
