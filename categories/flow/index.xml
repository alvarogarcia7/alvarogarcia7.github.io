      <description>This is another tool for your toolbox: using git to automatically document your development process (special cases only.)
Context When I&amp;rsquo;m spiking a feature, I usually get in the zone (e.g., Csikszentmihalyi&amp;rsquo;s Flow), and I can forget my good engineering practices, searching for that desired answer. After a few of those bouts of coding, you realize you&amp;rsquo;re wandering. You circle around, get lost, get back on track, then get lost again.</description>

      <description>In the prologue of the book, while thanking everyone that has made the book possible:
 [&amp;hellip;], none of the people mentioned here would be responsible for any inaccuracy that might exist in the book, as this responsibility is exclusively mine
Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (translated)1, prologue of &amp;ldquo;Flow&amp;rdquo;
 (More posts on this same book, here)
This connects with what Dan North said in the Craft Conf about this idea of the &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;m the only one in the company producing good quality work, the rest are not doing the same&amp;rdquo;.</description>
