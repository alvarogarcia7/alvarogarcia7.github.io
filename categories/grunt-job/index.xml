      <description>This was a low-hanging fruit as a team member who specialises in QA complained about testing in the last moment during the last sprint&amp;rsquo;s retrospective.
Did the grunt job of connecting the dots and configuring the maven project (using jbehave). Also, got the inspiration from a tutorial.
Announced it only as it was in place and QA approved of it
This grunt job clicked with Sweep the floor
Let&amp;rsquo;s see how the sprint goes and what are the pain points during this sprint</description>
