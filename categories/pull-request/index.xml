      <description>Overheard today at the office, while they were discussing the approval of a pull request:
 [Pull request reviewer] - I&amp;rsquo;m sorry, can&amp;rsquo;t approve this: I don&amp;rsquo;t really agree with this design. Isn&amp;rsquo;t there an alternative for this?
[Pull request author] - [redacted], of course you don&amp;rsquo;t, you&amp;rsquo;re the guardian of the source
[PR reviewer] - Well, sometimes I&amp;rsquo;m a bit picky about introducing bad code into our codebase.
 This has made me think about Gandalf blocking the path of Balrog Demon, shouting &amp;ldquo;[you shall not pass][you-shall-not-pass-meme]&amp;rdquo; while on top of the bridge.</description>
