      <description>Motivation Today, at a client, in the green phase, we had a test suite which was failing: the whole suite fails but the test cases, individually, succeed.
So my first impression was that something was being shared between tests. Also confirmed because the failing class was an EndToEnd test, in which we load the whole spring context
A quick glance was not revealing anything interesting, so I decided to find which is the minimum suite (as opposed as to the whole suite) that makes the new testcase fail, expecting to narrow the search for possible causes.</description>
