      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve found this quote very interesting from the book &amp;ldquo;The Craftsman&amp;rdquo;, by Richard Sennett:
 Animal laborans is, as the name implies, the human being akin to a beast of burden, a drudge condemned to routine. Arendt enriched this image by imagining him or her absorbed in a task that shuts out the world, a state well exemplified by Oppenheimer&amp;rsquo;s feeling that the atomic bomb was a &amp;ldquo;sweet&amp;rdquo; problem, or Eichmann&amp;rsquo;s obsession with making the gas chambers efficient.</description>
