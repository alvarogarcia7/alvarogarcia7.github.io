      <description>Introduction In any programming language, it is common to compose functions by pipelining functions: h = g âˆ˜ f such that h(x) = g(f(x)).
The function f is applied first, then g, then the following. 1
For me, it would be more comfortable and easy to understand to write it f COMPOSE_THEN g, indicating that this function composition is not the usual, but a different operation.
Introduction in Clojure This function composition can be written in Clojure by pipelining or chaining functions:</description>

      <description>Call me maybe: RabbitMQ I&amp;rsquo;ve read this article by Kyle Kingsbury on using RabbitMQ as a lock service. It investigates and gives a counterexample of using it for this purpose.
Uses Knossos to do the testing and surfaces a problem with it. Explains specific problems on locking: at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery
Note: References Jepsen (I guess an inside joke to the song &amp;ldquo;Call me maybe&amp;rdquo; by Carly Rae Jepsen) for at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery.</description>

      <description>Today, at a client, I&amp;rsquo;ve facilitated the brown-bag session on Clojure, introducing Lisp&amp;rsquo;s homoiconicity.
Session Structure The session was designed as a kata, first introducing participants in the problem, letting some time to read the initial version and to think about possible solutions.
Then, I structured the rest of the time as a prepared kata, where I was explaining in the beamer our current problems (day-to-day tasks) and possible solutions in Clojure.</description>

      <description>Inserting this code in the blog:
```clojure (defn all-access[k] (let [{:keys [a b] :as k}] (do a) (do (:b k)))) ```  the octopress processor throws the error:
Error: Pygments can&#39;t parse unknown language: clojure Error: Run jekyll build --trace for more information.  A solution would be to include it as lisp code:
```lisp (defn all-access[k] (let [{:keys [a b] :as k}] (do a) (do (:b k)))) ```  this is an example:</description>
