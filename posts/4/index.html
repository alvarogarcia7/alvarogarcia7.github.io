  <div class="entry-content"><h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Today, at a client, in the green phase, we had a test suite which was failing: the whole suite fails but the test cases, individually, succeed.</p>

<p>So my first impression was that something was being shared between tests. Also confirmed because the failing class was an EndToEnd test, in which we load the whole spring context</p>

<p>A quick glance was not revealing anything interesting, so I decided to find which is the minimum suite (as opposed as to the whole suite) that makes the new testcase fail, expecting to narrow the search for possible causes. This is very similar to what QuickCheck does, to generate the minimum testcase that breaks your property. In this way, you can focus in a possibly simpler<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> feature.</p>

<p>This post covers how to perform this search.</p>

<h2>Mathematical formulation</h2>

<p>Let <code>T</code> be a sequence of tests: <code>i1, i2, ..., in, F, j1, j2, ..., jm</code></p>

<p>where:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>i</code> are green tests</li>
<li> <code>F</code> is first failing test

<ul>
<li>when executed in isolation, is green</li>
<li>when executed in the sequence, is red</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li> <code>j</code> are tests after the failed test.</li>
</ul>


<p>In this case, the order is important, as the failed test suite (presumably) comes from a shared state set by a previous test.</p>

<p>The first search-space pruning is to remove the <code>j</code>, as they supposedly don&rsquo;t have any effect (as they are after the failed test)</p>

<p>let <code>T1</code> be a subsequence of <code>T</code> that includes <code>i</code> and <code>F</code>: <code>i1, i2, ..., in, F</code></p>

<p>Then it is assumed that one (or more) of the <code>i</code> generates an inconsistent state that makes <code>F</code> fail.</p>

<p>In the sequence <code>T1</code>, <code>F</code> fails, but in the sequence <code>TF</code> composed by <code>F</code> only, the test succeeds. This can be thought as the equivalent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem">Intermediate value theorem</a>, also called Bolzano&rsquo;s theorem, where the <code>T1</code> is at one side ot the axis and the <code>TF</code> at another. The theorem proves that there must be at least one value where the domain of the function crosses the axis</p>

<p>I say &ldquo;thought of&rdquo; because that theorem is only for continous functions and sets are not (are discrete) but the analogy is good enough: if one sequence is OK but the other isn&rsquo;t, there must be a minimum sequence where the result is OK and another one where the results are not. They two sequences must not be the same case as one result cannot be OK and not OK at the same time.</p>

<h2>Naïve search</h2>

<p>The first way of searching would be find the minimum set that fails:</p>

<ul>
<li>include <code>F</code>, then another from <code>i1,...,in</code> that makes the <code>F</code> fail. <code>F</code> the last one, because it needs to be affected by the side effects from the preceding test.</li>
<li>if the first strategy does not work, for each of the above cases, add another from the <code>i1,...,in</code> (except the one that was added)</li>
</ul>


<p>For the first step, it takes <code>O(n * 2)</code>, assuming executing a single test costs <code>O(1)</code>. Reduces to <code>O(n)</code></p>

<p>For the second step, <code>O(n * n-1 * 3)</code>. Reduces to <code>O(n^2)</code></p>

<p>For the third step, <code>O(n * n-1 * n-2 * 4)</code>. Reduces to <code>O(n^3)</code></p>

<p>For the nth step, it costs <code>O(n * n-1 * n-2 * ... * n-(n-1) * (n+1))</code>. Reduces to <code>O(n^n)</code>. Which is polynomical but not feasible for medium-sized <code>n</code> (in an automatic fashion) or small <code>n</code> (in a manual fashion)</p>

<h2>Dichotomous search</h2>

<p>(This is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a>)</p>

<p>Inspired by <code>git-bisect</code>, I decided to treat the sequence <code>i1, ..., in</code> as the source for the dicotomical search, applying the subsequences to <code>F</code>.</p>

<p>The first step, it takes <code>O(n/2 * n/2)</code> = <code>O(n^2)</code> to execute half the tests</p>

<p>The second step, is to execute half the number of the tests previously executed, either from the sequence before (if the <code>F</code> fails) or from the other half (if <code>F</code> does not fail). The cost is <code>O(n/4 * n/4)</code> = <code>O(n^2)</code></p>

<p>For the nth step, the cost is <code>O(n/2^n * n/2^n)</code> = <code>O(n^2/2^n)</code> = <code>O(0)</code></p>

<p>This n in the nth step is smaller than the other n, as each step divides by two the amount of tests to be included.</p>

<p>The amount of tests to be executed is <code>n + n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + ... + 1</code> which is roughly <code>2n</code>. Executing each test costs <code>O(1)</code> (by the assumption before), so the total cost is <code>O(2n)</code> = <code>O(n)</code></p>

<p>If we take it by the amount of steps we need to manually execute is 1 for the whole, 1 for the half, 1 for the quarter, &hellip;. = <code>O(log2 n)</code></p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>To keep the executed tests, I created a support branch where I deleted the tests that were selected to be excluded. Always executed &ldquo;all tests in the suite&rdquo; as this makes it faster to select in the IDE.</p>

<p>When the half taken was wrong, I reverted the last commit and selected the other half.</p>

<p>After finding the minimum sequence and solving the issue, this support branch was discarded</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the real scenario, with around 100 tests, searching manually in the naïve way would not have been possible. It would have cost 100 steps, as the minimum set that produces <code>F</code> had size 2 (so only one step was necessary).</p>

<p>Applying the dichotomous search, in 8-10 steps I had finished, with the guarantee that no matter how many tests produced the <code>F</code> I would have found it in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Finally, the root cause for the failing test <code>F</code> was the OrientDB InMemory implementation with Spring context, as the former does not allow two instances at the same time in the same JVM.</p>

<p>It was solved using <code>@DirtiesContext</code> in both cases of the minimum sequence that forms <code>F</code>, so no matter which order the executor decides, the context will always be clean for the next execution.</p>

<p>We found this thanks to a teammate&rsquo;s intuition.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve found this quote very interesting from the book &ldquo;The Craftsman&rdquo;, by Richard Sennett:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>Animal laborans</em> is, as the name implies, the human being akin to a beast of burden,
a drudge condemned to routine. Arendt enriched this image by imagining him or her absorbed
in a task that shuts out the world, a state well exemplified by Oppenheimer&rsquo;s feeling that the
atomic bomb was a &ldquo;sweet&rdquo; problem, or Eichmann&rsquo;s obsession with making the gas chambers
efficient. In the act of making it work, nothing else matters; Animal laborans takes the work as
end end it itself.</p>

<p>By contrast, <em>Homo faber</em> is her image of men and women doing another kind of work, making
a life in common. Again Arendt enriched an inherited idea. The Lating tag Homo faber
means simple &ldquo;man as maker&rdquo;. [&hellip;] Homo faber is the judge of material labor and practice, not
Animal laborans&rsquo;s colleague but his supertior. Thus, in her view, we human beings live in two
dimensions, In one we make things; in this condition we are amoral, absorbed in a task. We
also harbor another, higher way of life in which we stop producing and start discussion and
judging together. Whereas Animal laborans is fixated in the question &ldquo;How?&rdquo; Homo faber
asks &ldquo;Why?&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Many times I&rsquo;ve written this function:</p>

<p>It may depend on the case, whether it is <code>[]</code>, <code>[)</code>, <code>(]</code> or <code>()</code>, to use mathematical terms.</p>

<p>When the two comparisons are the same (<code>[]</code> and <code>()</code>), there is duplication in the comparisons.</p>

<p>Investigating a little bit on this in clojure, I&rsquo;ve found this function:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='lisp'><span class='line'><span class="nb">&lt;=</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And its <a href="https://clojuredocs.org/clojure.core/%3C=">clojuredocs</a>: Returns non-nil if nums are in monotonically non-decreasing order,
otherwise false.</p>

<p>A sample usage:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='lisp'><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span>

</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">&lt;=</span> <span class="mi">1</span> <span class="mi">2</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c1">; false</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>The last part is the most interesting one. As this function is prepared to receive more than two parameters, it is very easy for the programmer to use it. We could say that the language was prepared for that.</p>

<p>Inspired by this, I&rsquo;ve implemented the same function in haskell (for the repl):</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Unless a more elegant, language-provided solution exists in haskell, the clojure one is way simpler. This is one of the benefits of prefix notation, that operators (e.g., <code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, <code>&lt;=</code>) are overloaded to take more arguments than before.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>From the Chapter 3, Managing Dependencies, from the book Practical Object-Oriented Design in Ruby, by Sandi Metz:</p>

<blockquote><p>An object has a dependency when it knows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The name of another class. [&hellip;]</li>
<li>The name of a message that it intends to send to someone other than self. [&hellip;]</li>
<li>The arguments that a message requires. [&hellip;]</li>
<li>The order of those arguments. [&hellip;]</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>If an object knows any of these facts about another object, it has dependencies to the other.</p>

<p>This is not to say that having dependencies to others is bad, as</p>

<blockquote><p>A single object cannot know everything, so inevitably it will have to talk to another object.
Chapter 3, Managing Dependencies, Introduction</p></blockquote>

<p>For this latter purpose, there is the section &ldquo;Writing loosely coupled code&rdquo;</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>At a client, today I&rsquo;ve facilitated a brown-bag session introducing the Clojure language to a group of java programmers.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started hands-on, live coding on a REPL. To make things easier, I&rsquo;ve created a maven project that imports the clojure jar and lets you obtain dependencies from clojars. The repo is <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/clojure-for-java-devs">here</a>. This repo wouldn&rsquo;t have been possible without the <a href="https://github.com/talios/clojure-maven-plugin">clojure maven plugin</a>, written by Mark Derricutt.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve more or less followed <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/clojure-for-java-devs/blob/master/guide.md">this guide</a></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve also practiced, using a dojo in clojure, the fizzbuzz kata.</p>

<p>There is a sample implementation in the same repo, <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/clojure-for-java-devs/tree/sample-implementation/src">this folder</a>.</p>

<blockquote><p>I find that several problems in Haskell can be solved by involving the type system
further: The trick is to involve the type system in ways that provide a big benefit
for the cost, but not going so far that the type system gets in the way of code
that you know &ndash;but can’t easily prove to the compiler&ndash; is safe</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also learned the concept of the quasi-quoter: similar to a preprocessor, executed at compile time and type-checked</p>

<h2>Hammock Driven Development</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">this video</a> by Rich Hickey. A few notes:</p>

<p>A: identifying a problem that we&rsquo;re trying to solve</p>

<p>D: assessing if the proposed solution solves the problem</p>

<p>the union of the features is not the purpose of the product / is not the product</p>

<p>proramming is not completing features</p>

<p>avoiding problems /= solving problems</p>

<p>book: how to solve it - G. Polya. Practices &amp; techniques for solving mathematic problems</p>

<p>How to solve the problem</p>

<ul>
<li>state the problem</li>
<li>understand the problem:

<ul>
<li>what do you know: facts, context, constraints.</li>
<li>what do you don&rsquo;t know</li>
<li>are there related problems? solutions to related problems. find an analogy: starting from scratch vs incremental step</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>be discerning</li>
<li>more input, better output:

<ul>
<li>read about your domain problem, research papers (maybe ACM)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>tradeoffs:

<ul>
<li>find at least two options (ups and downs) to compare before taking a decision</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Focus time for programmers like alone time for kids. Hammock time is important mind&rsquo;s eye time</p>

<p>Waking mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>critical thinking</li>
<li>analysis</li>
<li>tactics</li>
<li>prone to local maxima</li>
<li>feed work to background mind</li>
<li>analyze its products</li>
</ul>


<p>Background mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>making connections</li>
<li>synthesis</li>
<li>strategy</li>
<li>abstracts, analogies</li>
<li>solves most non-trivial problems</li>
</ul>


<p>loading it: work it hard in the waking mind to be included in the background mind</p>

<p>abstraction = software strategy</p>

<p>tip: small answer is better than big answer (occam&rsquo;s razor?)​</p>

<h2>The Humble Programmer</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.cs.utexas.edu/users/EWD/transcriptions/EWD03xx/EWD340.html">this EWD</a> about the necessary humbleness for being a programmer and the slow expansion of the trade, as compared to hardware engineers.</p>

<p>He cites six reasons for preferring to be a humble programmer:</p>

<ul>
<li>the programmer only needs to manage simple programs</li>
<li>simple programs imply reducing the search space</li>
<li>construct a program from a mathematical proof instead of test its properties after building the software. see quote below</li>
<li>a good abstraction can hide much complexity and difficulty</li>
<li>the importance of the used tool in the final product</li>
<li>&ldquo;the only problems we can satisfactory solve are the ones that admit a factored solution&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>In this essay I&rsquo;ve found the idea of</p>

<blockquote><p>Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs</p></blockquote>

<p>That <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">Wikiquote</a> attributes to an earlier paper (in 1969). In this paper, the verbatim quote is:</p>

<blockquote><p>program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.</p></blockquote>

<p>This idea also connects to the &ldquo;lower bounds&rdquo; and &ldquo;upper bounds&rdquo; of program correctness expressed in the article <a href="https://cdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/01/09/an-old-article-i-wrote/">An Old Article I Wrote</a> which is about static types, by Cdsmith. Admittedly, much later, in 2008, so this idea could be inspired by the Dijkstra&rsquo;s article.</p>
