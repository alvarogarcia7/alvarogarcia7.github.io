  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today we&rsquo;ve discussed about code reviews on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Barcelona-Software-Craftsmanship/events/220293683/">this open space</a></p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>These are my notes, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce information silos all around the company, as everyone [technical] can participate in these events</li>
<li>raise the &ldquo;just arrived&rdquo; people&rsquo;s knowledge [Difficult to hit the ground up and running, but these code review sessions can help]</li>
<li>invest one person as &lsquo;sheriff&rsquo; for the sprint: they will take care of static analysis tools (such as sonar) and continuous integration (CI; such as jenkins). They will make sure others follow the working agreements</li>
<li>In the academic environment, some teams do share their patches via mailing lists and this makes it much slower to adapt and review changes [As compared to an on-line sharing system - like web-based interfaces to distributed version control systems] As this team doesn&rsquo;t have a CI tool, they must test it / try it manually before reviewing the code.</li>
<li>Pair programming does not remove the need for code review [This has been surfaced twice]</li>
<li>Your work is not more important than your team members&#8217; one. [Related to not having time to code review]</li>
<li>Do code reviews include architecture? [We&rsquo;ve agreed that the architecture to some degree should be discussed before code reviews]</li>
<li>&ldquo;Troll review&rdquo;</li>
<li>Anyone can veto pull requests [By opening a question; do not allow for pull requests to be closed with open questions]</li>
<li>A 15-minute time slot everyday to code review [As code hygiene; Done right after lunch,  breakfast or just before leaving, when you&rsquo;re tired]</li>
<li>Code review tasks have higher priority than other tasks [Do not take other tasks if there are code reviews to do]</li>
<li>Code reviews put a lot of pressure so people learn and the knowledge level equalizes across the team</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p> My conclusions, even though some of them were not shared by everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most of the people approve of code review practices: either they are doing them or are trying to apply them at their clients. (Warning: this was a code review meetup, so there&rsquo;s a bias: people not interested in them won&rsquo;t come). No one was against doing them.</li>
<li>Code reviews have a cost, although it is beneficial to do them</li>
<li>Should your teammates not want to participate in the code review after agreeing on doing them, appeal to their professionalism / accountability, then to their time (stated before), then troll them: after a few (healthy) trolling code review sessions, people will feel more comfortable reviewing and being reviewed. Special mention to Miguel who coined (?)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> the term: troll review.</li>
<li>Great way of equalizing the (technical) knowledge level within the team</li>
<li>Great way of reduce information silos across the whole company</li>
<li>They can be fun if you do them properly</li>
<li>The need for code reviews do not disappear when pair programming: as long as you have a personal attachment to the code, you might not see its defects.</li>
</ul>

<p>after searching some ten minutes on the internet, there are only a couple of questions on meta.codereview stackoverflow, but not related to this. <strong>Update</strong>: In <a href="https://twitter.com/mallyvai/status/314260072798752768">here</a>, Vaibhav Mallya talks about a #trollReview, related to code.

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday we organized a TDD meetup at the <a href="http://www.fib.upc.edu/fib.html">FIB - Barcelona School of Informatics UPC</a>, within <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Barcelona-Software-Craftsmanship/">Barcelona Software Craftsmanship</a> sponsored by the <a href="http://jediupc.com/">Junior Empresa d&#8217;Inform√†tica</a>. The meetup started at 9:00 until 18:00, with a one-hour pause in the middle.</p>

<h2>Where</h2>

<ul>
<li>Please make sure the meetup space (e.g., classroom, meeting room) is available and ready to be used at least 15 minutes before the meetup starts</li>
<li>The organizer and the event host should be there in advance to prepare the physical environment (chairs, wifi, beamer, etc) as well as mentally: getting comfortable with the space, loading the presentation, prepare the speaker notes, etc.</li>
<li>Plan for the worse and hope for the best: in this particular meetup, the beamer was not available, so the host gracefully lent us some 23 inch screen as a second monitor.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What</h2>

<ul>
<li>The speaker should have had already decided what they are going to cover on the meetup and not deviate much from this. Leave some empty buffer space at the end because you will cumulate some deviation during the day.</li>
<li>Of course, have the slides ready if you plan on using them</li>
<li>I prefer having more conversations during the meetup rather than a masterclass-style one. The organizer(s) should act as conversation moderators, often guiding the conversation where (they think) it is most useful. Sometimes, it is a good idea to interrupt the conversation when someone is getting bored or losing focus<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Be prepared to ask to your attendees what do they want: they are your target</li>
<li>Please ask to your attendees to bring their laptop with git, dependency manager, IDE / editor, test double framework installed. Otherwise, most of the first session is invested in downloading / configuring these.</li>
<li>Please try to be communicative / funny in some way. This makes the slides easier to understand</li>
</ul>


<h2>Meetup details</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>We did two sessions of slides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction to TDD</li>
<li>TDD on a daily basis: learn TDD for a greater good</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>We did three katas:</p>

<ul>
<li>LinkedList: <a href="http://codekata.com/kata/kata21-simple-lists/">source</a>. Originally by <a href="http://twitter.com/@pragdave">Dave &ldquo;Pragmatic Dave&rdquo; Thomas</a></li>
<li>Password: <a href="https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/c031d6b621f28b85ce0d">source</a>. Taken from <a href="http://twitter.com/@trikitrok">Manuel Rivero</a>, also seen on a <a href="http://twitter.com/@carlosble">Carlos Bl√©</a> workshop</li>
<li>Bank Kata: <a href="https://github.com/sandromancuso/Bank-kata">source</a>. Originally from <a href="http://twitter.com/@sandromancuso">Sandro Mancuso</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The format was this: the first set of slides, the two first katas, some discussion, then lunch; coffee (mandatory); the second set of slides, the third kata (done by them), later done by me at the beamer, explaining the situation and my mental process.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Useful feedback</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>About the event:</p>

<ul>
<li>One 8-hour event is much more effective / efficient that 4 2-hour ones</li>
<li>No one complained about the lack of beamer. So don&rsquo;t worry too much if your host doesn&rsquo;t have one, as long as everybody can get close to the (big) screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>About the LinkedList kata:</p>

<ul>
<li>This, as a first TDD example was too complex. Getting into TDD with classes, and serveral functions at the same time might be difficult.</li>
<li>Too academic. This is an example you will usually never implement yourself, as there are libraries who provide it. Therefore, not applicable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>About the Password kata:</p>

<ul>
<li>They graded this kata easier than the linkedList</li>
<li>Start with this as it is only a function</li>
<li>This has didactic value as there are some gotchas with this kata</li>
<li>More likely to be implemented by yourself, as most systems require some kind of user authentication</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>About the Bank kata:</p>

<ul>
<li>More resembling of a day-to-day problem</li>
<li>This is a difficult kata if you haven&rsquo;t learned about mocks / test doubles</li>
<li>Interesting interactions between objects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For me:</p>

<ul>
<li>They liked both the format and the speaker (a.k.a., me)</li>
<li>They thought this meetup was well prepared in advance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>My own feedback:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is difficult to ask the attendees to rate their own level or for you to rate it. I thought the linkedlist example would be so easy they would finish it in half the allowed time<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, but it wasn&rsquo;t this way</li>
<li>The productivity level varies hugely from person to person. There were some pairs that dug thoroughly on the problem and others who got stuck (sometimes with the language). Even though both types of pairs were working hard on the proposed problem</li>
<li>We still haven&rsquo;t solved the problem with reservations: many people book a seat on the event but later won&rsquo;t come. This makes other (interested) attendees to not have a seat.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I&rsquo;ve built a small maven module, to be used directly with cucumber. You can fork the repository <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/base-bdd-cucumber">here</a></p>

<p>This is the setup I&rsquo;ve proposed for the meetup <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Barcelona-Meetup/events/220673134/">&ldquo;BDD Cucumber kata (gherkin + code)&rdquo;</a>. Will see if this code is successfully used by the ~40 participants in a couple of weeks</p>

<p>(Quote from the <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/base-bdd-cucumber/blob/master/README.md">README.md</a>):</p>

<p>This maven project has been possible due to <a href="https://twitter.com/@thomassundberg">Thomas Sundberg</a> and <a href="https://thomassundberg.wordpress.com/2014/05/29/cucumber-jvm-hello-world">this post</a></p>

<p>Should you want to, there&rsquo;s a tweet to thank him the effort: <a href="https://twitter.com/intent/tweet?text=@thomassundberg%20thanks%20for%20the%20cucumber%20bdd%20tutorial!%20Will%20be%20using%20it%20from%20@agilebcn;Keep%20up%0Athe%20good%20work&amp;url=https://thomassundberg.wordpress.com/2014/05/29/cucumber-jvm-hello-world/">tweet intent here</a></p>

<li>tricks about the tool:

<ul>
<li>order of the dependencies (especially junit, hamcrest)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>plugins and how to build one</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Last Friday we did a kata<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> using a projector the string calculator <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> using pair programming, TDD and some mob-programming for the last refactoring.</p>

<p>We used a projector (beamer) so everyone could see it. I tried to take really small baby steps but the adding part was done in ~6 cycles<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup></p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all learnt about shotcuts, live user templates for the IDE <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup>, TDD methodology, other ways of tackling the problem, how to refactor as a group, clean code, etc</p>

<p>These sessions are necessary to share some knowledge among the teammates and have another chance of doing code review, releasing some pressure from daily practices or bad abstractions / designs (that will be taken care of in the future)</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve had such a great time, learning together, that would be a candidate for a weekly interaction.</p>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming">Mob programming</a> is such an eye opening practice. It forces you to reconsider your previous dogma and to understand the others&#8217; positions. Wikipedia reads &ldquo;early use of phrase [&hellip;] was made in &lsquo;Extreme Programming Perspectives&rsquo;&rdquo; but this practice is practiced by some, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/carlosble">Carlos Bl√©</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sandromancuso">Sandro Mancuso</a> among others; also at the <a href="http://www.softwarecraftsmanshipbarcelona.org/">Software Craftsmanship Barcelona</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/scbcn2013?src=hash">2013</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SCBCN14?src=hash">2014</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/socracan?src=hash">SoCra Canaries 2015</a></p>

<h2>One goal</h2>

<p>Our goal for this session was to practice TDD and baby steps, so the team can improve its ability on these skills.</p>

<p>In any case, my objective for the katas (or deliberate practice) is not to get there as fast as we can but to improve our automated routines. This can affect our daily performance, as it becomes natural. It is not about the getting to the destination but enjoying the path along the way. In this manner, you are not so hurried up about a slow train but enjoy the views across the window.</p>

<p>It was good that QA people in the team came to the session. He even participated with some tips / implementations during the refactors. Always fruitful to discuss (and learn) mixed skills (QA / dev) from the other side of the wall</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>I still haven&rsquo;t mastered the recipe (algorithm) for knowing when it is a scaffold and when it&rsquo;s time to refactor using &ldquo;replace algorithm&rdquo;. For know, I just use the three (3) rule and a bit of gut feeling on the side. The bad thing is that this can not be easily taught to someone else. Just learnt by osmosis and practice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>A quote from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Mythical-Man-Month-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959">Mythical Man-Month</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Chapter 13: The Whole and the Parts</p>

<p>[&hellip;] In System/360 engineering models, one saw occasional strands of purple wire among the routine yellow wires. When a bug was found, two things were done. A quick fix was devised and installed on the system, so testing could proceed. This change was put on in purple wire, so it stuck out like a sore thumb. It was entered in the log. Meanwhile, an official change document was prepared and started into the design automation mill. Eventually this resulted in updated drawings and wire lists, and a new back panel in which the change was implemented in printed circuitry or yellow wire. Now the physical model and the paper were together again, and the purple wire was gone.</p>

<p>Programming needs a purple-wire technique, and it badly needs tight control and deep respect for the paper that ultimately is the product. The vital ingredients of such technique are the logging of all changes in a journal and the distinction, carried conspicuously in source code, between quick patches and thought-through, tested, documented fixes.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><quote> Brooks, F. - The Mythical Man-Month</quote></p></blockquote>

<p>This purple-wire the author talks about is extremely important even in the current age as the whole team should not be blocked by a single defect.</p>

<p>What I usually do is a commit containing a quick fix (purple-wire, scaffold, hackish if, etc) on a bugfix branch, push the changes so jenkins can verify that this purple-wire didn&rsquo;t break any other case. Then integrate this bugfix into master if required<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. If this affects <code>develop</code> branch of other developers, also merge into develop and or feature branches.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in my opinion, fixing the defect should include an unit test so the defect does not reproduce again. If this is not reproducible through an unit one, escalate test levels (unit, integration, end to end, etc) until a suitable one is found.</p>

<p>Once that applying the purple-wire is done, I <code>checkout</code> the last version where the defect is to be found (usually right before the bugfix branch) and create this test necessary to reproduce behavior. Only after this defect is found I fix it. Otherwise, I think the root cause might be in a different place and, therefore, fix a non-existing defect, effectively introducing a regression.</p>

<p>This test also serves to reproduce that the corrected behavior is not introduced anymore into the system.</p>

<p>As an ending phase for the defect, replace the purple wire with the new code and, after passing all tests, merge to master, develop and feature branches.</p>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>If the found defect is not business critical, I try not to merge to master the purple wire, just leave master pointing to the defect and the bugfix branch with the solution. This bugfix branch will be deleted when a more stable fix is found.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

  <div class="entry-content"><h2>The toolsmith</h2>

<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Frederick P Brooks, Jr</a> quoted / explained a theory explained by Mills and Baker<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> around 1971-72:</p>

<blockquote><p>Chapter 3: The Surgical Team</p>

<p>[&hellip;] but the team be organized like a surgical team rather than a hog-butchering team. That is, instead of each member cutting away on the problem, one does the cutting and the others give him[her] every support that will enhance his[her] effectiveness and productivity.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><quote> Brooks, F. - The Mythical Man-Month, chapter 3: The Surgical Team </quote></p></blockquote>

<p>(Text between square brackets is mine)</p>

<p>The author goes on to explain the job descriptions for the surgeon, copilot, administrator, editor, secretaries, program clerk, toolsmith, tester and the language lawyer.</p>

<p>The one that will be covered in this post is the toolsmith:</p>

<blockquote><p><strong>The toolsmith</strong>. File-editing, text-editing, and interactive debugging services are now readily available, so that a team will rarely need its own machine and machine-operating crew. But these services must be available with unquestionably satisfactory response and reliability; and the surgeon must be sole judge of the adequacy of the service available to him. He needs a toolsmith, responsible for ensuring this adequacy of the basic service and for constructing, maintaining, and upgrading special tools &ndash;mostly interactive computer services&ndash; needed by his team. Each team will need its own toolsmith, regardless of the excellence and reliability of any centrally provided service, for his job is to see to the tools needed or wanted by his surgeon, without regard to any other team&rsquo;s needs. The tool-builder will often construct specialized utilities, cataloged procedures, macro libraries.</p>

<p><quote> Brooks, F. - The Mythical Man-Month, chapter 3: The Surgical Team </quote></p></blockquote>

<p>Even though the chapter reads a bit outdated, especially with the part about genders and methodologies (i.e., waterfall), the part about roles is interesting. The surgical team, as the author presents will be composed by 9 &frac12; (nine and a half) as the language lawyer can be shared among two or three teams.</p>

<h2>Day to day practices</h2>

<p>So, one full-time job is to build tools to service the surgeon and the copilot (1:8,5 ratio), or approximately 12% of a full-time position.</p>

<p>These tools can make the surgeon and the copilot more effective, ranging from a single digit percentage to orders of magnitude in other tasks.</p>

<p>As agile teams no longer have a toolsmith and the scrum master is not necessarily a technical expert who can build tools for the whole team, the tasks of creating tools must be taken care by everyone. No one better than yourself can know your needs and tailor solutions for them.</p>

<p>The only downside is you have to invest ~5h (for a full time position) per week into creating and polishing tools for your work: it is a need for achieving more productivity when working.</p>

<p>Nowadays that IDEs are configurable, this time might be invested on learning more advanced features as other shortcuts, refactoring techniques, other design patterns, etc. I like having my own live templates (see <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/creating-and-editing-live-templates.html#d1333587e219">description</a>), especially for tests, as I saw on the <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/courses/503-sandro-mancuso-s-crafting-code-course#programme">Crafting Code workshop</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/sandromancuso">Sandro Mancuso</a></p>

<p>It may also include other activities as setting up your bash alias, cleaning your desk, trying a new UML diagram modeler, etc. Anything that improves the productivity of your main task.</p>

<p>If we consider our experience and knowledge part of our tools (as we are knowledge workers), training could be considered part of polishing our tools. Short, daily or weekly training sessions (even internal) can make a great impact on breadth (not depth) of knowledge among your teammates. This shallow knowledge can open doors for more knowledge to be gained outside of company time, or used to practice and test other methods.</p>

<p>This training is so useful for everyone (&ldquo;when one teaches, two learn&rdquo;) that I recommend my clients to do it. This has helped them cope with changing technologies, knowledge transfer and even some team building.</p>

<h2>Company provided or not?</h2>

<p>Should the company provide for this time to improve? Although I don&rsquo;t know the answer, it would greatly affect the programmers&#8217; productivity to do so. I would say, provide this time as long as what is produced is useful. How do you measure useful? This is a subjective opinion, so it depends on each one.</p>

<p>Some companies acknowledge that this is so important as to invest part of their resources (0-2 hours per week) into training.</p>

<p>Either way, should your company provide it for your or not, you are the one in charge of your career (from Mancuso, <a href="https://leanpub.com/socra">Software Craftsmanship</a> - now called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Software-Craftsman-Professionalism-Pragmatism-Robert/dp/0134052501/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416521895&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+software+craftsman">The Software Craftsman</a>). If you are not allowed to invest company time for your own benefit, you could use some of your personal time to do so. It is not required, but you will soon enjoy its profits.</p>

<h2>Examples</h2>

<ul>
<li>Every sprint, one of my clients (as of 2015-05) wants to review the work done using some slides and a live demo. The &lsquo;sample&rsquo; slides with the format, layout is useful. Everything that should be replaced (timestamp, contents, etc) is marked with a TODO</li>
<li>Every day, I commit plenty of times to the control version system (i.e., git). I have an alias for commit, diff, status, etc, that saves me some keystrokes on the most common commands</li>
<li>See the post &ldquo;A basic working environment&rdquo;</li>
<li>Deployment, even on local, is automated: a script for getting the latest <code>branch</code>, <code>develop</code> or <code>master</code> code, build the Docker container, start the docker image, notify me the code is ready</li>
<li>Pipeline: I have a pipeline, in local, where I can push and the tests will be executed automatically. If the build fails (usually BDD tests), I can <code>push -f</code> without affecting to the repo history.</li>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is one of the best legacy code introductions I&rsquo;ve seen:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Grand Redesign in the Sky</p>

<p>Eventually the team rebels. They inform management that they cannot continue to develop in this odious code base. They demand a redesign. Management does not want to expend the resources on a whole new redesign of the project, but they cannot deny that productivity is terrible. Eventually they bend to the demands of the developers and authorize the grand redesign in the sky.</p>

<p>A new tiger team is selected. Everyone wants to be on this team because it&rsquo;s a greenfield project. They get to start over and create something truly beautiful. But only the best and brightest are chosen for the tiger team. Everyone else must continue to maintain the current system.</p>

<p>Now the two teams are in a race. The tiger team must build a new system that does everything that the old system does. Not only that, they have to keep up with the changes that are continuously being made to the old system. Management will not replace the old system until the new system can do everything that the old system does.</p>

<p>This race can go on for a very long time. I&rsquo;ve seen it take 10 years. And by the time it&rsquo;s done, the original members of the tiger team are long gone, and the current members are demanding that the new system be redesigned because it&rsquo;s such a mess.</p>

<p><cite> Robert C. Martin </cite> in the chapter 1: Clean Code from the book by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/">the same name</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Also, why should you estimate the new tiger team abilities better than the old tiger team? Is it because the language, tools, or just because they are &ldquo;plain better&rdquo;?</p>

<p>What guarantees that the resulting software is going to be better than the old one?</p>

<p>Another interesting definition of legacy code is Michael Feather&rsquo;s one (code without tests).</p>
