  <div class="entry-content"><p>In the last TDD workshop (experience report <a href="../../../../2015/04/12/jason-gorman-tdd-intensive-workshop">here</a>), a conversation with <a href="http://twitter.com/@garymcleanhall">Gary McLean Hall</a> introduced to me this new concept of &ldquo;Redesign&rdquo; as a TDD phase.</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>

<p>As Gary introduced it to me<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, it is a phase that might appear after refactor.</p>

<p>It is about changing the outside design without changing the expected behavior. I thought this was also included in the refactor phase.</p>

<h2>How I do redesign</h2>

<p>I usually do this &ldquo;changing of the outside design&rdquo; by applying a series of refactors <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> to the production code but not changing the test code; using a bridge / adapter to get to the new API from the old one. Later you can inline the scaffold and use the new API directly.</p>

<p>The same for the test code: when you want to change design in the test code, do not modify production code (a.k.a. model code).</p>

<h2>Other thoughts</h2>

<p>Merriam-Webster defines &ldquo;<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/redesign">redesign</a>&rdquo; as</p>

<blockquote><p>to change the design of (something)</p></blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote><p>to revise in appearance, function, or content</p></blockquote>

<p>an example:</p>

<blockquote><p>The book&rsquo;s cover has been redesigned for the new edition.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Refactoring book (by Martin Fowler) describes &ldquo;refactoring&rdquo; as</p>

<blockquote><p>Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure</p></blockquote>

<p>Taken literally, the public API is not internal but external structure, so changing it, should belong to a phase that is not refactor (see definition), nor red (no failing tests), not green (making it pass). Maybe this phase is &ldquo;redesign&rdquo; or we have to take the refactoring phase less literally so it includes redesign. Any thoughts?</p>

<h2>Other references</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve searched for redesign and refactor and <a href="https://practicingruby.com/articles/refactoring-is-not-redesign">this blog post</a> came up. They cite redesign as a way of rewriting</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/80758/1181094">This answer</a> and the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/80758/1181094">original question</a> in StackOverflow is interesting</p>

<p>Redesign also appears cited in <a href="http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2014-01-25-the-failures-of-intro-to-tdd.html">this blog post</a></p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is an experience report on <a href="http://twitter.com/@jasongorman">Jason Gorman</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.codemanship.co.uk/tdd.html">Test-driven development intensive workshop</a>&rdquo; on the April 11th, 2015</p>

<p>I attended this training in the <a href="http://www.grenfell-housing.co.uk/">Greenfell housing &amp; training</a> in South Wimbledon, London SW19 1JZ. The training spanned from 10:00 to 17:00 with a half an hour for lunch plus three or four 10-15 minute pauses. (7 - ,5 - 4 * 12/60 = ~5.7hours = 5 hours 45 minutes)</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>There were 23 of us, including me. We spent some half hour introducing ourselves before the training started. I remember about a tester that came to the workshop &ldquo;wanting to know more about this testing methodology&rdquo;. Jason&rsquo;s answer was priceless: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but you came to the wrong place: this is not about testing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At 10:00 sharp, he started a set of slides explaining what TDD is about, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>productivity:

<ul>
<li>no company is willing to give you a &ldquo;get out of jail free&rdquo; card to get out of the productivity zone</li>
<li>a drop in the productivity, at least for the first weeks</li>
<li>you have to find a time slot in your schedule to practice TDD, otherwise it&rsquo;s like learning to swim while crossing the Atlantic Ocean</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have to feel uncomfortable not doing TDD</li>
<li>triangulation:

<ul>
<li>how each problem is different</li>
<li>you can only learn it by doing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TDD styles:

<ul>
<li>Chicago style by Kent Beck. Reference book would be &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-By-Example/dp/0321146530">TDD by example</a>&rdquo;</li>
<li>London school or Mockist style by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce. Reference book would be <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/">&ldquo;Growing object oriented software, guided by tests</a>"</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>13 good habits for a sustainable test-driven development way</li>
<li>The basic TDD cycle:

<ul>
<li>an executable specification, encoded in a failing test</li>
<li>pass the test in the simplest way</li>
<li>refactor</li>
<li>(talking with another attendee, he described to me a new TDD phase called redesign. Maybe another post will explain this in deeper detail level)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some ideas about <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/simple.html">Simple design, simple development, simplicity</a> (<a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org">XP</a>)</li>
<li>Shown a wrong example of mixing assertions (state) and verifications (interactions)</li>
<li>More than one reason to go wrong makes the code non-trivial anymore. Non-trivial code requires tests</li>
<li>You want to see the test failing for the right reason: remove / finish code that does not compile, fix null pointers, array out of bounds exceptions, etc. See it fail with &ldquo;was <X> but expected <Y>&rdquo; or &ldquo;NoInteractionException&rdquo; (hamcrest error and mockito error, respectively; both java)</li>
<li>Duplication as a sign of design smell</li>
<li>Process of generalizing code: discover the need for patterns</li>
<li>The most difficult skill in TDD is refactoring [and design; note is mine]. The TDD cycle is very easy.

<ul>
<li>TDD is much more in demand than refactoring, even though the former includes the latter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refactor until you&rsquo;re happy with the code, until you stand by it</li>
</ul>


<h2>CRC Cards</h2>

<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card">Class-responsibility-collaboration card</a> is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>top: class name</li>
<li>half left: responsibilities</li>
<li>half right: collaborations</li>
</ul>


<p>Notes from the slides:</p>

<ul>
<li>each then is an outcome

<ul>
<li>do not mix outcomes and implications. An example: after winning the lottery, the money should be transferred to my bank account and I can buy a yacht. The former is an outcome (change in state) and the latter an implication (a new action that is now enabled)</li>
<li>an outcome is mapped to an assertion, while a collaboration is mapped to an interaction (verify in mockito)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Given / When / Then is not enough to implement an executable specification. We need examples, detail</li>
<li>OO: send messages to distribute responsibility.

<ul>
<li>A Then is an unique responsibility</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Topmost object: no one connects with it</li>
<li>Put the work where the data is</li>
<li>Tell, don&rsquo;t ask <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> vs data driven design (tell a collaborator what to do vs ask for values and do the work yourself)</li>
<li>You want as few interactions as possible (related to the tell, don&rsquo;t ask)</li>
<li>More objects than outcomes is a bad thing (design smell) (?)</li>
<li>CRC is a very mechanical exercise, do not over think it</li>
<li>Describe outcomes as changes in OO (new, destroy, relationships, modify fields / state)</li>
<li>Continuous integration is not necessarily about shipping the code at each commit but having it shippable at each commit, as always having a product that is ready for its production phase</li>
</ul>


<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>All exercises were done in pairs, always switching one half of the pair. He asked for someone in the pair to raise, especially if you were not a programmer (e.g., tester, manager)</p>

<h3>First exercise: Banking</h3>

<blockquote><p>Write a program that is capable of transferring money from an account to another</p></blockquote>

<p>A chance to practice arrange, act, assert</p>

<p>Later, he did it some live coding to develop the same kata, practicing &ldquo;<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/TDD-as-if-You-Meant-It">TDD as if you meant it</a>&rdquo; (<a href="https://twitter.com/keithb_b">Keith Braithwaite</a>&rsquo;s original idea). We discovered together the &ldquo;primitive obsession&rdquo; and &ldquo;feature envy&rdquo; smells. We tried doing as few decisions as possible.</p>

<h3>Second exercise: Fibonacci sequence generator</h3>

<blockquote><p>Write a program that is capable of generating Fibonacci sequences, no shorter that 8 and no longer than 50</p></blockquote>

<p>A chance to practice baby steps.</p>

<p>My pair and I had the chance of discovering the importance of understanding correctly the requirements before writing a line of code. Also, I learned about the different ways of doing TDD. In this case, my pair executed the tests via a main (java class) and saw the failures on the console. When proposed to do it in the JUnit runner the IDE has, he said he preferred it in his own ways.</p>

<p>Jason did some live coding to show how he approached and triangulated this exercise.</p>

<p>I really liked some of what he said: I like to make the API correct from the first moment so I will ask questions that are correct but only check answers for things that I have already implemented. Example:</p>

<p>As the generated sequence can only have <code>8 &lt;= x &lt;= 50</code> elements, a list returning a single element would not be correct. So</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Third exercise: FizzBuzz</h3>

<blockquote><p>Write a program that is capable of returning a string with all numbers less than 100 that are using the FizzBuzz pattern. This FizzBuzz pattern converts the divisors of 3 to &lsquo;fizz&rsquo;, divisors of 5 to &lsquo;buzz&rsquo; and divisors to both to &lsquo;fizzbuzz&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>I discovered that this FizzBuzz is a drinking game in the UK.</p>

<h3>Fourth exercise: CRC cards</h3>

<p>Before this exercise there was a short introduction on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card">Class-responsibility-collaboration card</a>, explained above</p>

<p>Following an example about a movie library, there were six user stories, described at high level, without acceptance criteria.</p>

<p>We had to create an acceptance criteria for this user story. Later create a set of CRC cards and finally partially implement said feature.</p>

<p>Very interesting exercise, such a pity that there wasn&rsquo;t more time to complete this exercise or see him doing it</p>

<h2>Knowledge pearls</h2>

<p>He dropped some knowledge pearls (that I&rsquo;m going to use myself):</p>

<p>Close concepts interested in responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conceptual diagram and class diagram</li>
<li>Instance diagram</li>
<li>Knowledge map and tag cloud</li>
</ul>


<p>Regarding legacy code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Isolate big balls of mud into parts and test these as end-to-end. Also connected to isolating groups of nodes into the class graph</li>
<li>Understand what the code does, not the architecture</li>
<li>Do not use a mock to help you test legacy code, use it just as a design tool. (It might be a good idea to use it temporarily while you refactor, but remove it afterwards)</li>
<li>Tests with mocks double down on the design: if it is broken, it will be a drag more than help</li>
</ul>


<p>Test on the boundaries. Many times we test in the middle of the algorithm but forget the boundaries, where many special cases hide</p>

<p>The GOOS book is pronounced like the goose animal (&ldquo;/gús/&rdquo;) in English</p>

<p>He said he never copy pastes <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<ul>
<li>This is a two day workshop condensed on a single day. It shows. In my opinion, it would be better to do fewer exercises and dig deeper in them rather than try so many approaches / exercises</li>
<li>The CRC exercise was well thought and really massaged. It touches the right spots and makes you want to learn more about the subject</li>
<li>Promiscuously pairing is always a good idea, as you don&rsquo;t know what level have your attendees. Get stuck for the whole day with someone who has a (very) different knowledge level than you might spoil the workshop</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t see the benefit of doing the fizzbuzz kata after having done the Fibonacci sequence one</li>
<li>In my opinion, there were too many breaks. Doing a break in the morning (10-15 mins), lunch (30 mins) and afternoon (10-15 mins) is enough</li>
</ul>


<p>On a personal note:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is not enough to attend the workshop. You have to take notes and study them at home later. (Thanks <a href="http://spines.me">spines</a> for this lesson)</li>
<li>I really had a great time, learned a lot, even though I already know something about TDD</li>
<li>Met very interesting people</li>
<li>Would attend to the workshop again</li>
</ul>


<p>In general, I&rsquo;d like to thank Jason and the other attendees for making this workshop possible. I had a blast there.</p>

<p>Disregarding the tests, the production code is complete. Could be better, but it is ready if you are in a hurry.</p>

<p>Now, picture your test as a plant in a plant pot: it might be healthy on the outside (external quality) but how are their roots (internal quality)?</p>

<p>Do you imagine them in an ordered fashion or in a jungle of roots? Everything on the outside is connected to one or several roots? In case it is several, what / how much do they share?</p>

<h2>Trimming the roots</h2>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s imagine you want to put the plant in a different plant pot. You don&rsquo;t want the plant to be altered in any way: keep producing fruits as it was before, as green and shiny, etc. Just alter the container for business reasons.</p>

<p>The more tidy and organized the roots are related to the outside plant itself, the easier it is to reshape (or refactor) it.</p>

<p>So this is exactly what refactoring is about: &ldquo;keeping the same external behaviour, modifying the internal structure&rdquo;. I like to explain as &ldquo;modify how it is done but not what it does&rdquo;.</p>

<p>When you trim the roots but leave unaltered the top, you are making it cheaper to modify the internal shape without affecting the rest. The plant will continue to grow, requiring more and more nutrients from the ground. Small increases that do not warrant a bigger plant pot, as the current one can withstand the new requirements.</p>

<p>This is where the analogy is no longer useful: when writing software, you&rsquo;re also making it easier to reuse, modify and maintain.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The more tidied up you have your plants, the cheaper to maintain and modify.</p>

<p>Software implementation details are like roots: they expand to find any small hole where to expand. Even to scaffold expected behaviour</p>

<p>Trim your plants early and often, always with the help of a test suite</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday, <a href="http://twitter.com/@trikitrok">Manuel Rivero</a> and I facilitated a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Barcelona-Software-Craftsmanship/events/221463037/">workshop</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/tree/master/TDDMicroExercises/Java/TirePressureMonitoringSystem">tire pressure</a> TDD microexercise. (More microexercises can be found in <a href="/blog/categories/microexercise">this category</a>, also <a href="https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/tree/master/TDDMicroExercises">here</a>)</p>

<p>We scheduled the session as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>10 minutes introduction to the exercise</li>
<li>10 minutes to download the code and take a first look</li>
<li>10 minutes explanation about the exercise, what the problem is, etc</li>
<li>30 minutes for the attendees to explore the solution (on their own)</li>
<li>10 minutes for commenting the explored solutions, comments about it</li>
<li>40 minutes of prepared kata format</li>
<li>10 minutes of final explanations, questions and answers (Q&amp;A)</li>
</ul>


<p>Total: 120 minutes or two hours, approximately</p>

<p>We decided that one would be mostly at the keyboard and the other mostly explaining. This allows for the speaker to introduce some concepts while the driver is performing a larger refactor / step.</p>

<p>Some of our own feedback:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have the kata prepared, clear all your doubts before doing it live</li>
<li>Be very specific about the goal of the kata: the narrower the focus, the more we will learn</li>
<li>If necessary, exercise your shortcuts / practices one last time</li>
<li>Set up the font as big as needed. Even remove some whitelines (present in your usual code) so more text can fit in the screen.</li>
<li>It was very useful for us to have a small script of what we would perform: what was the idea, where to stop to explain things, etc</li>
<li>A prepared kata is a show (like a movie), so the dialogs between the performing pair are important. Do not be afraid to tell the reasons why you did this last refactor.</li>
<li>Answer the questions as you go, do not wait until the end of the session</li>
</ul>


<p>Some feedback we received:</p>

<ul>
<li>It would have been useful to do a recap at the end of the session, to refresh the most important concepts</li>
<li>In general the session was good, they were satisfied with the techniques shown there</li>
<li>The exercise was concise and small, perfect for two hours' time</li>
</ul>


<p>Many thanks to all the attendees and to Manuel: I learnt a lot from the session and renewed my energies to keep doing these workshop sessions. Also thanks to Luca Minudel for writing these awesome exercises.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This is the first post is of the <a href="/blog/categories/growing-software">growing-software series</a></p>

<p>A few weeks ago, while reading the book <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/">Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/@natpryce">Nat Pryce</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/@sf105">Steve Freeman</a>, I finally understood why the software needs to be grown and not built:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>.<a href="https://twitter.com/natpryce">@natpryce</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/sf105">@sf105</a> With the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/goos?src=hash">#goos</a> book I finally grasped the importance of growing, not building software. Thanks for writing it</p>&mdash; Alvaro Garcia (@alvarobiz) <a href="https://twitter.com/alvarobiz/status/570835142136049664">February 26, 2015</a></blockquote>


<script async src="//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script>


<p>A few days ago, I was thinking about new inspiration sources and this came to my mind:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>If we want to grow software instead of building it, should we start looking at gardening and agriculture for new inspiration? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/goos?src=hash">#goos</a></p>&mdash; Alvaro Garcia (@alvarobiz) <a href="https://twitter.com/alvarobiz/status/581005906667687938">March 26, 2015</a></blockquote>


<p>In agriculture, at least in this latitude, there are different seasons. Different plants have different temporal schedules: you need to plant, wait for it to bloom, produce fruits then collect. Maybe remove the plant and wait for the next time slot to appear.</p>

<p>When growing software, things are different (or we think so):</p>

<ul>
<li>Do we need to plant? Yes, seed the project with resources</li>
<li>Wait for it to bloom? Yes, from an outside actor perspective, there is no result for a while, even if it is one sprint</li>
<li>Wait to produce fruits? Yes, usually some sprints past the minimum viable product (MVP) until the minimum lovable product (MLP)</li>
<li>Do we need to collect it? Yes, usually the final tests (e.g., regression) and ship it to production to be used.</li>
</ul>


<p>After all, we might say that the process is not so different in both activities. Nothing to do related to tools or materials, etc.</p>

<p>As in agriculture, seasons vary in productivity for a certain activity or crop: during the cold months, not many plants are able to produce fruits. Meanwhile, during the hot months, harvest is much higher. (This only applies to outdoors gardening.)</p>

<p>When producing software, there might be seasons too:</p>

<ul>
<li>Seasons where productivity (harvest) varies

<ul>
<li>Lowers when a new team member joins (see the Mythical Man-Month), the pressure is too high, salaries are low, &hellip;</li>
<li>Increases when there are no information silos, the bus factor is high, the team is not affected by external distractions, &hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seasons where different harvests can be planted, but a subset of them will be the most effective

<ul>
<li>A front-end developer can do back-end, but it won&rsquo;t be as productive. In this area, one can learn other disciplines and get as effective as other professionals.</li>
<li>There are many tasks to be done but the prioritized ones are more effective</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some harvests are more intense on the fields than others. After that, there is a required rest so the next season is as productive as the previous one

<ul>
<li>Some projects produce burn-out so some slack time is more productive than getting to work again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>But there might be differences too:</p>

<ul>
<li>Geographical distribution: some crops cannot grow in certain conditions. I believe any geographic area (e.g., country) can produce any type of work (e.g., back-end, front-end, quality assurance, project management, etc)</li>
<li>Quality distribution: same as before, many crops do not grow in Iceland (due to the harsh environment) or do it with lower quality as nearer to the Equator.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/adibolb">Adrian Bolboaca</a> has written a very interesting post on being a community bumble-bee. (Source can be found <a href="http://blog.adrianbolboaca.ro/2015/03/talk-agile-lean-europe-2014-being-a-community-bumble-bee/">here</a>)</p>

<p>He goes on to explain how he has visited many meetups all over Europe and the big chunk of information and experience he has learned from them.</p>

<p>He tells us about a selfish approach to organizing meetups:</p>

<blockquote><p>When one teaches two learn</p>

<p>(apparently attributed to) Robert Heinlein, <a href="http://www.math.niu.edu/~rusin/nonwork/quotes">source</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I share this feeling of learning while teaching, as long as you reflect and analyze (e.g., <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hansei">hansei</a> or <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch05.html#reflect_as_you_work">reflect as you work</a>). I also try to apply it to my meetups.</p>

<p>As a funny note, he said this cross-pollination has crystallized in as many ideas as to fill three books.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today we&rsquo;ve discussed about code reviews on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Barcelona-Software-Craftsmanship/events/220293683/">this open space</a></p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>These are my notes, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce information silos all around the company, as everyone [technical] can participate in these events</li>
<li>raise the &ldquo;just arrived&rdquo; people&rsquo;s knowledge [Difficult to hit the ground up and running, but these code review sessions can help]</li>
<li>invest one person as &lsquo;sheriff&rsquo; for the sprint: they will take care of static analysis tools (such as sonar) and continuous integration (CI; such as jenkins). They will make sure others follow the working agreements</li>
<li>In the academic environment, some teams do share their patches via mailing lists and this makes it much slower to adapt and review changes [As compared to an on-line sharing system - like web-based interfaces to distributed version control systems] As this team doesn&rsquo;t have a CI tool, they must test it / try it manually before reviewing the code.</li>
<li>Pair programming does not remove the need for code review [This has been surfaced twice]</li>
<li>Your work is not more important than your team members' one. [Related to not having time to code review]</li>
<li>Do code reviews include architecture? [We&rsquo;ve agreed that the architecture to some degree should be discussed before code reviews]</li>
<li>&ldquo;Troll review&rdquo;</li>
<li>Anyone can veto pull requests [By opening a question; do not allow for pull requests to be closed with open questions]</li>
<li>A 15-minute time slot everyday to code review [As code hygiene; Done right after lunch,  breakfast or just before leaving, when you&rsquo;re tired]</li>
<li>Code review tasks have higher priority than other tasks [Do not take other tasks if there are code reviews to do]</li>
<li>Code reviews put a lot of pressure so people learn and the knowledge level equalizes across the team</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p> My conclusions, even though some of them were not shared by everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most of the people approve of code review practices: either they are doing them or are trying to apply them at their clients. (Warning: this was a code review meetup, so there&rsquo;s a bias: people not interested in them won&rsquo;t come). No one was against doing them.</li>
<li>Code reviews have a cost, although it is beneficial to do them</li>
<li>Should your teammates not want to participate in the code review after agreeing on doing them, appeal to their professionalism / accountability, then to their time (stated before), then troll them: after a few (healthy) trolling code review sessions, people will feel more comfortable reviewing and being reviewed. Special mention to Miguel who coined (?)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> the term: troll review.</li>
<li>Great way of equalizing the (technical) knowledge level within the team</li>
<li>Great way of reduce information silos across the whole company</li>
<li>They can be fun if you do them properly</li>
<li>The need for code reviews do not disappear when pair programming: as long as you have a personal attachment to the code, you might not see its defects.</li>
</ul>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday we organized a TDD meetup at the <a href="http://www.fib.upc.edu/fib.html">FIB - Barcelona School of Informatics UPC</a>, within <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Barcelona-Software-Craftsmanship/">Barcelona Software Craftsmanship</a> sponsored by the <a href="http://jediupc.com/">Junior Empresa d'Informàtica</a>. The meetup started at 9:00 until 18:00, with a one-hour pause in the middle.</p>

<h2>Where</h2>

<ul>
<li>Please make sure the meetup space (e.g., classroom, meeting room) is available and ready to be used at least 15 minutes before the meetup starts</li>
<li>The organizer and the event host should be there in advance to prepare the physical environment (chairs, wifi, beamer, etc) as well as mentally: getting comfortable with the space, loading the presentation, prepare the speaker notes, etc.</li>
<li>Plan for the worse and hope for the best: in this particular meetup, the beamer was not available, so the host gracefully lent us some 23 inch screen as a second monitor.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What</h2>

<ul>
<li>The speaker should have had already decided what they are going to cover on the meetup and not deviate much from this. Leave some empty buffer space at the end because you will cumulate some deviation during the day.</li>
<li>Of course, have the slides ready if you plan on using them</li>
<li>I prefer having more conversations during the meetup rather than a masterclass-style one. The organizer(s) should act as conversation moderators, often guiding the conversation where (they think) it is most useful. Sometimes, it is a good idea to interrupt the conversation when someone is getting bored or losing focus<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>.</li>
<li>Be prepared to ask to your attendees what do they want: they are your target</li>
<li>Please ask to your attendees to bring their laptop with git, dependency manager, IDE / editor, test double framework installed. Otherwise, most of the first session is invested in downloading / configuring these.</li>
<li>Please try to be communicative / funny in some way. This makes the slides easier to understand</li>
</ul>


<h2>Meetup details</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>We did two sessions of slides:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction to TDD</li>
<li>TDD on a daily basis: learn TDD for a greater good</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>We did three katas:</p>

<ul>
<li>LinkedList: <a href="http://codekata.com/kata/kata21-simple-lists/">source</a>. Originally by <a href="http://twitter.com/@pragdave">Dave &ldquo;Pragmatic Dave&rdquo; Thomas</a></li>
<li>Password: <a href="https://gist.github.com/trikitrok/c031d6b621f28b85ce0d">source</a>. Taken from <a href="http://twitter.com/@trikitrok">Manuel Rivero</a>, also seen on a <a href="http://twitter.com/@carlosble">Carlos Blé</a> workshop</li>
<li>Bank Kata: <a href="https://github.com/sandromancuso/Bank-kata">source</a>. Originally from <a href="http://twitter.com/@sandromancuso">Sandro Mancuso</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>The format was this: the first set of slides, the two first katas, some discussion, then lunch; coffee (mandatory); the second set of slides, the third kata (done by them), later done by me at the beamer, explaining the situation and my mental process.</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Useful feedback</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>About the event:</p>

<ul>
<li>One 8-hour event is much more effective / efficient that 4 2-hour ones</li>
<li>No one complained about the lack of beamer. So don&rsquo;t worry too much if your host doesn&rsquo;t have one, as long as everybody can get close to the (big) screen.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>About the LinkedList kata:</p>

<ul>
<li>This, as a first TDD example was too complex. Getting into TDD with classes, and serveral functions at the same time might be difficult.</li>
<li>Too academic. This is an example you will usually never implement yourself, as there are libraries who provide it. Therefore, not applicable.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>About the Password kata:</p>

<ul>
<li>They graded this kata easier than the linkedList</li>
<li>Start with this as it is only a function</li>
<li>This has didactic value as there are some gotchas with this kata</li>
<li>More likely to be implemented by yourself, as most systems require some kind of user authentication</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>About the Bank kata:</p>

<ul>
<li>More resembling of a day-to-day problem</li>
<li>This is a difficult kata if you haven&rsquo;t learned about mocks / test doubles</li>
<li>Interesting interactions between objects</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>For me:</p>

<ul>
<li>They liked both the format and the speaker (a.k.a., me)</li>
<li>They thought this meetup was well prepared in advance</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>My own feedback:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is difficult to ask the attendees to rate their own level or for you to rate it. I thought the linkedlist example would be so easy they would finish it in half the allowed time<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, but it wasn&rsquo;t this way</li>
<li>The productivity level varies hugely from person to person. There were some pairs that dug thoroughly on the problem and others who got stuck (sometimes with the language). Even though both types of pairs were working hard on the proposed problem</li>
<li>We still haven&rsquo;t solved the problem with reservations: many people book a seat on the event but later won&rsquo;t come. This makes other (interested) attendees to not have a seat.</li>
</ul>
