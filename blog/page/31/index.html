        <p>Last Friday we did a kata<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> using a projector the string calculator <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup> using pair programming, TDD and some mob-programming for the last refactoring.</p>
<p>We used a projector (beamer) so everyone could see it. I tried to take really small baby steps but the adding part was done in ~6 cycles<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup></p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve all learnt about shotcuts, live user templates for the IDE <sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>, TDD methodology, other ways of tackling the problem, how to refactor as a group, clean code, etc</p>
<p>These sessions are necessary to share some knowledge among the teammates and have another chance of doing code review, releasing some pressure from daily practices or bad abstractions / designs (that will be taken care of in the future)</p>
<p>We&rsquo;ve had such a great time, learning together, that would be a candidate for a weekly interaction.</p>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mob_programming">Mob programming</a> is such an eye opening practice. It forces you to reconsider your previous dogma and to understand the others' positions. Wikipedia reads &ldquo;early use of phrase [&hellip;] was made in &lsquo;Extreme Programming Perspectives&rsquo;&rdquo; but this practice is practiced by some, such as <a href="https://twitter.com/carlosble">Carlos Bl√©</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/sandromancuso">Sandro Mancuso</a> among others; also at the <a href="http://www.softwarecraftsmanshipbarcelona.org/">Software Craftsmanship Barcelona</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/scbcn2013?src=hash">2013</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/SCBCN14?src=hash">2014</a> and the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/socracan?src=hash">SoCra Canaries 2015</a></p>
<h2 id="one-goal">One goal</h2>
<p>Our goal for this session was to practice TDD and baby steps, so the team can improve its ability on these skills.</p>
<p>In any case, my objective for the katas (or deliberate practice) is not to get there as fast as we can but to improve our automated routines. This can affect our daily performance, as it becomes natural. It is not about the getting to the destination but enjoying the path along the way. In this manner, you are not so hurried up about a slow train but enjoy the views across the window.</p>
<p>It was good that QA people in the team came to the session. He even participated with some tips / implementations during the refactors. Always fruitful to discuss (and learn) mixed skills (QA / dev) from the other side of the wall</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I still haven&rsquo;t mastered the recipe (algorithm) for knowing when it is a scaffold and when it&rsquo;s time to refactor using &ldquo;replace algorithm&rdquo;. For know, I just use the three (3) rule and a bit of gut feeling on the side. The bad thing is that this can not be easily taught to someone else. Just learnt by osmosis and practice.</p>

        <p>A quote from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Mythical-Man-Month-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959">Mythical Man-Month</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chapter 13: The Whole and the Parts</p>
<p>[&hellip;] In System/360 engineering models, one saw occasional strands of purple wire among the routine yellow wires. When a bug was found, two things were done. A quick fix was devised and installed on the system, so testing could proceed. This change was put on in purple wire, so it stuck out like a sore thumb. It was entered in the log. Meanwhile, an official change document was prepared and started into the design automation mill. Eventually this resulted in updated drawings and wire lists, and a new back panel in which the change was implemented in printed circuitry or yellow wire. Now the physical model and the paper were together again, and the purple wire was gone.</p>
<p>Programming needs a purple-wire technique, and it badly needs tight control and deep respect for the paper that ultimately is the product. The vital ingredients of such technique are the logging of all changes in a journal and the distinction, carried conspicuously in source code, between quick patches and thought-through, tested, documented fixes.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Brooks, F. - The Mythical Man-Month<!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>This purple-wire the author talks about is extremely important even in the current age as the whole team should not be blocked by a single defect.</p>
<p>What I usually do is a commit containing a quick fix (purple-wire, scaffold, hackish if, etc) on a bugfix branch, push the changes so jenkins can verify that this purple-wire didn&rsquo;t break any other case. Then integrate this bugfix into master if required<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup>. If this affects <code>develop</code> branch of other developers, also merge into develop and or feature branches.</p>
<p>On the other hand, in my opinion, fixing the defect should include an unit test so the defect does not reproduce again. If this is not reproducible through an unit one, escalate test levels (unit, integration, end to end, etc) until a suitable one is found.</p>
<p>Once that applying the purple-wire is done, I <code>checkout</code> the last version where the defect is to be found (usually right before the bugfix branch) and create this test necessary to reproduce behavior. Only after this defect is found I fix it. Otherwise, I think the root cause might be in a different place and, therefore, fix a non-existing defect, effectively introducing a regression.</p>
<p>This test also serves to reproduce that the corrected behavior is not introduced anymore into the system.</p>
<p>As an ending phase for the defect, replace the purple wire with the new code and, after passing all tests, merge to master, develop and feature branches.</p>

<li id="fn:1" role="doc-endnote">
<p>If the found defect is not business critical, I try not to merge to master the purple wire, just leave master pointing to the defect and the bugfix branch with the solution. This bugfix branch will be deleted when a more stable fix is found. <a href="#fnref:1" class="footnote-backref" role="doc-backlink">&#x21a9;&#xfe0e;</a></p>

        <p>I&rsquo;ve just written a new kata, about a persistent linked list.</p>
<p>It is using the same project as for the <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/kata-linkedlist">linked list kata</a>.</p>
<p>For now, only the <code>add</code>, <code>contains</code> and <code>size</code> methods are implemented.</p>

        <h2 id="the-toolsmith">The toolsmith</h2>
<p><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks">Frederick P Brooks, Jr</a> quoted / explained a theory explained by Mills and Baker<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> around 1971-72:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Chapter 3: The Surgical Team</p>
<p>[&hellip;] but the team be organized like a surgical team rather than a hog-butchering team. That is, instead of each member cutting away on the problem, one does the cutting and the others give him[her] every support that will enhance his[her] effectiveness and productivity.</p>
<p>[&hellip;]</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Brooks, F. - The Mythical Man-Month, chapter 3: The Surgical Team <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>(Text between square brackets is mine)</p>
<p>The author goes on to explain the job descriptions for the surgeon, copilot, administrator, editor, secretaries, program clerk, toolsmith, tester and the language lawyer.</p>
<p>The one that will be covered in this post is the toolsmith:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>The toolsmith</strong>. File-editing, text-editing, and interactive debugging services are now readily available, so that a team will rarely need its own machine and machine-operating crew. But these services must be available with unquestionably satisfactory response and reliability; and the surgeon must be sole judge of the adequacy of the service available to him. He needs a toolsmith, responsible for ensuring this adequacy of the basic service and for constructing, maintaining, and upgrading special tools &ndash;mostly interactive computer services&ndash; needed by his team. Each team will need its own toolsmith, regardless of the excellence and reliability of any centrally provided service, for his job is to see to the tools needed or wanted by his surgeon, without regard to any other team&rsquo;s needs. The tool-builder will often construct specialized utilities, cataloged procedures, macro libraries.</p>
<p><!-- raw HTML omitted --> Brooks, F. - The Mythical Man-Month, chapter 3: The Surgical Team <!-- raw HTML omitted --></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Even though the chapter reads a bit outdated, especially with the part about genders and methodologies (i.e., waterfall), the part about roles is interesting. The surgical team, as the author presents will be composed by 9 1/2 (nine and a half) as the language lawyer can be shared among two or three teams.</p>
<h2 id="day-to-day-practices">Day to day practices</h2>
<p>So, one full-time job is to build tools to service the surgeon and the copilot (1:8,5 ratio), or approximately 12% of a full-time position.</p>
<p>These tools can make the surgeon and the copilot more effective, ranging from a single digit percentage to orders of magnitude in other tasks.</p>
<p>As agile teams no longer have a toolsmith and the scrum master is not necessarily a technical expert who can build tools for the whole team, the tasks of creating tools must be taken care by everyone. No one better than yourself can know your needs and tailor solutions for them.</p>
<p>The only downside is you have to invest ~5h (for a full time position) per week into creating and polishing tools for your work: it is a need for achieving more productivity when working.</p>
<p>Nowadays that IDEs are configurable, this time might be invested on learning more advanced features as other shortcuts, refactoring techniques, other design patterns, etc. I like having my own live templates (see <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/help/creating-and-editing-live-templates.html#d1333587e219">description</a>), especially for tests, as I saw on the <a href="https://skillsmatter.com/courses/503-sandro-mancuso-s-crafting-code-course#programme">Crafting Code workshop</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/sandromancuso">Sandro Mancuso</a></p>
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<!-- raw HTML omitted -->
<p>It may also include other activities as setting up your bash alias, cleaning your desk, trying a new UML diagram modeler, etc. Anything that improves the productivity of your main task.</p>
<p>If we consider our experience and knowledge part of our tools (as we are knowledge workers), training could be considered part of polishing our tools. Short, daily or weekly training sessions (even internal) can make a great impact on breadth (not depth) of knowledge among your teammates. This shallow knowledge can open doors for more knowledge to be gained outside of company time, or used to practice and test other methods.</p>
<p>This training is so useful for everyone (&ldquo;when one teaches, two learn&rdquo;) that I recommend my clients to do it. This has helped them cope with changing technologies, knowledge transfer and even some team building.</p>
<h2 id="company-provided-or-not">Company provided or not?</h2>
<p>Should the company provide for this time to improve? Although I don&rsquo;t know the answer, it would greatly affect the programmers' productivity to do so. I would say, provide this time as long as what is produced is useful. How do you measure useful? This is a subjective opinion, so it depends on each one.</p>
<p>Some companies acknowledge that this is so important as to invest part of their resources (0-2 hours per week) into training.</p>
<p>Either way, should your company provide it for your or not, you are the one in charge of your career (from Mancuso, <a href="https://leanpub.com/socra">Software Craftsmanship</a> - now called <a href="http://www.amazon.co.uk/Software-Craftsman-Professionalism-Pragmatism-Robert/dp/0134052501/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1416521895&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=the+software+craftsman">The Software Craftsman</a>). If you are not allowed to invest company time for your own benefit, you could use some of your personal time to do so. It is not required, but you will soon enjoy its profits.</p>
<h2 id="examples">Examples</h2>
<ul>
<li>Every sprint, one of my clients (as of 2015-05) wants to review the work done using some slides and a live demo. The &lsquo;sample&rsquo; slides with the format, layout is useful. Everything that should be replaced (timestamp, contents, etc) is marked with a TODO</li>
<li>Every day, I commit plenty of times to the control version system (i.e., git). I have an alias for commit, diff, status, etc, that saves me some keystrokes on the most common commands</li>
<li>See the post &ldquo;A basic working environment&rdquo;</li>
<li>Deployment, even on local, is automated: a script for getting the latest <code>branch</code>, <code>develop</code> or <code>master</code> code, build the Docker container, start the docker image, notify me the code is ready</li>
<li>Pipeline: I have a pipeline, in local, where I can push and the tests will be executed automatically. If the build fails (usually BDD tests), I can <code>push -f</code> without affecting to the repo history.</li>

Management does not want to expend the resources on a whole new redesign of the project, but they cannot deny that productivity is terrible. Eventually they bend to the demands of the developers and authorize the grand redesign in the sky.</p>
<p>A new tiger team is selected. Everyone wants to be on this team because it&rsquo;s a greenfield project. They get to start over and create something truly beautiful. But only the best and brightest are chosen for the tiger team. Everyone else must continue to maintain the current system.</p>
<p>Now the two teams are in a race. The tiger team must build a new system that does everything that the old system does. Not only that, they have to keep up with the changes that are continuously being made to the old system. Management will not replace the old system until the new system can do everything that the old system does.</p>
<p>This race can go on for a very long time. I&rsquo;ve seen it take 10 years. And by the time it&rsquo;s done, the original members of the tiger team are long gone, and the current members are demanding that the new system be redesigned because it&rsquo;s such a mess.</p>

<p>Also, why should you estimate the new tiger team abilities better than the old tiger team? Is it because the language, tools, or just because they are &ldquo;plain better&rdquo;?</p>
<p>What guarantees that the resulting software is going to be better than the old one?</p>

        <p>I&rsquo;m currently reading the Apprenticeship patterns book, out of order (explained here: TODO).</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m writing down the read chapters in a text file, to measure progress and also be able to backtrack if necessary. This also makes reading the book a &ldquo;choose your own adventure&rdquo;</p>
<p>After reading approximately half the chapters, the navigation wasn&rsquo;t so easy using only the &ldquo;see also&rdquo; part. So I decided to break free from that constraint and start reading other chapters. But how do you know which chapters you have left to read? Knowing the whole set (<code>all</code>) and the read set (<code>read</code>) this is just the <code>all - read</code>.</p>
<p>Coming to a more practical way, how to know this is an automated (non-manual) way? There are <code>m</code> in <code>read</code> and n in <code>all</code>, where <code>m &lt;= n</code>.</p>
<p>The simplest approach would be:</p>
<pre><code>for each current in read:
  remove current from all
</code></pre><p>as read is is no particular order, that would yield some <code>O(m*n)</code>, worst case scenario (<code>m==n</code>), <code>O(n^2)</code>.</p>
<p>That is quite expensive, especially if you have to do it manually</p>
<p>If we use the same algorithm but sort the <code>read</code> set (no longer a set, as sets have no order). Also, converting it to a <code>O(1)</code> lookup table (e.g., a map), that would yield some <code>O(n log2 n + m)</code> that is already better. Taking into account that the sorting can be automated by the computer, it would yield a &ldquo;manual O notation cost&rdquo; of <code>O(1 + m)</code>. So, relative to the amount of chapters you have read.</p>
<p>But we can even do better in terms of this &ldquo;manual big o notation&rdquo;:</p>
<pre><code>read &lt;- sort read into a map ; cost O(1)
all &lt;- sort all into a map ; cost O(1)

unread &lt;- all - intersection(all, read) ; cost O(1)
</code></pre><p>And this is where the power tools come into place: if we use <code>comm</code> or <code>diff</code>, the computer will create  the <code>unread</code> set for us, in &ldquo;manual&rdquo; cost of <code>O(1)</code></p>
<h2 id="example-using-vim-sort-and-diff">Example using vim, sort and diff</h2>
<p>This is the <code>read</code> set (for the moment):</p>
<pre><code>the long road
draw your own map
find mentors
the deep end
create feedback loops
the white belt
practice, practice, practice
concrete skills
