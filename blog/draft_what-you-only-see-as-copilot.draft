This last week I've tried to apply the pilot-copilot technique where it was invented: driving. I've tried to compare it to pilot-copilot in software development; the condensed results are here:

## As driver

Whenever I was driving, my copilot took care of most of the minor details (e.g., passing sunglasses, credit card, reading maps, adjusting temperature) while I took care of the driving.

It is a responsibility to take the right choices (implementation details) while the copilot only provides high-level directions.

While driving, not as programming, you can't usually go back to fix a bad decision (although you can advance until the next U-turn), so some considerations vary: I cannot be at a 4-way crossing discussing which naming to apply. Maybe "the Surgical Model" from the "Mythical Man-Month" (F. P Brooks - [here][mythical-man-month]) applies more appropriately to these quick decisions.

## As copilot

There are things that only you see: that car coming at high speed, the kid playing with the ball on the other end of the street, etc. Many of these events should remain only to you, as there is no action required from the driver's part. More than should, sometimes must, as it would only introduce noise that decreases performance.

It is difficult to read the map when it does not reflect the land (e.g., outdated, not accurate). This is not usual with political maps, but, figuratively, very usual when dealing with product backlogs and other future development guides / estimations. It is required that the copilot takes care of the maps plus controls the current situation.

PS: I decided against applying to driving other pair programming techniques like ping-pong.
