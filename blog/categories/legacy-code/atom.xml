    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Working effectively with legacy code, Michael Feathers talks a type of tests to define or characterize the current behavior of the legacy system:</p>

<blockquote><p>In nearly every legacy system, what the system does is more important than what it is supposed to do.</p>

<p>A <em>characterization test</em> is a test that characterizes the actual behavior of a piece of code. [&hellip;] The test document the actual current behavior of the system. Here is a little algorithm for writing algorithm for writing characterization tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a piece of code in a test harness</li>
<li>Write an assertion that you know will fail</li>
<li>Let the failure tell you what the behavior is.</li>
<li>Change the test so that it expects the behavior that the code produces</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>


<p>M Feathers, in the chapter 13<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, section &ldquo;Characterization tests&rdquo; of Working effectively with legacy code. Actual page, 186.</p></blockquote>

<p>Later on, he goes to describe them in a bigger environment:</p>

<blockquote><p>Characterization tests record the actual behavior of a piece of code. If we find something unexpected when we write them, it pays to get some clarification. It could be a bu. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that we don&rsquo;t include the test in our test suite; instead, we should mark it as suspicious an find out what th effect would be of fixing it.</p>

<p>M Feathers, in the chapter 13<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, section &ldquo;Characterization tests&rdquo; of Working effectively with legacy code. Actual page, 188.</p></blockquote>

    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2016/04/17/brownish-greenfield-gilded-rose-kata-formulation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>(This formulation has been copied and adapted from <a href="https://twitter.com/NotMyself">Bobby Johnson</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/TerryHughes">Terry Hughes</a>&rsquo;s <a href="https://github.com/NotMyself/GildedRose">repository</a>)</p>

<h2>Formulation</h2>

<p>Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures.</p>

<p>Your task is to rewrite the system using an old class, that already exists.
First an introduction to our system:</p>

<ul>
<li>All items have a <code>SellIn</code> value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item</li>
<li>All items have a <code>Quality</code> value which denotes how valuable the item is</li>
<li>At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item</li>
</ul>


<p>Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li>Once the sell by date has passed, <code>Quality</code> degrades twice as fast</li>
<li>The <code>Quality</code> of an item is never negative</li>
<li>&ldquo;Aged Brie&rdquo; actually increases in <code>Quality</code> the older it gets</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sulfuras&rdquo;, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in <code>Quality</code></li>
<li>The <code>Quality</code> of an item is never more than 50, however &ldquo;Sulfuras&rdquo; is a legendary item and as such its <code>Quality</code> is 80 and it never alters.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Backstage passes&rdquo;, like aged brie, increases in <code>Quality</code> as it&rsquo;s <code>SellIn</code> value approaches; <code>Quality</code> increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but <code>Quality</code> drops to 0 after the concert</li>
<li>&ldquo;Conjured&rdquo; items degrade in <code>Quality</code> twice as fast as normal items</li>
</ul>


<p>Your task is to create the system from scratch, with only a restriction: you must use the class <code>Item</code> that Leeroy developed. This class is:</p>

<ul>
<li>unmodifiable, if you do, a goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn&rsquo;t believe in shared code ownership. This prohibition applies to modifying it, deleting it, adding new methods, deleting methodts, changing visibility of stuff, etc</li>
<li>cannot be inherited, if you do, a goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn&rsquo;t believe in code inheritance</li>
</ul>


<p>The <code>Item</code> class can be found in many programming languages in <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata">Emily Bache&rsquo;s repository</a>. You are looking for the class / type <code>Item</code></p>

<p>Happy katas and happy koding. Please be careful with the goblin!</p>

<h2>How to start</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create a new repo</li>
<li>Find the class <code>Item</code> in <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata">this repo</a></li>
<li>Use TDD to develop the functionality. Remember, <code>Item</code> will stay as it is.</li>
<li>Have fun</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I have done a brown bag session about refactoring legacy code. It includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>legacy code definition. There is no agreement about this in the team.</li>
<li>the legacy code change algorithm (source is Feathers, Working effectively with legacy code). Plus an example about it.</li>
<li>working with legacy code</li>
<li>experience with it.</li>
</ul>


<p>The slides are available <a href="/blog/categories/../uploads/refactoring-legacy-code-slides.pdf">here</a> (PDF format)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I have facilitated a brown bag session about refactoring legacy code applications, as this is the case with one of the applications we maintain and add new features to.</p>

<p>The contents of the session:</p>

<ul>
<li>Briefly exposing the problem to the team, me taking the role of the Product Owner (PO)</li>
<li>Ask the dev team to add an easy feature</li>
<li>Do it without tests, as it was so simple that they thought they could do it (using mob programming)</li>
<li>Ask if they were satisfied by the patch / fix. Answer was yes.</li>
<li>Point out that there are regressions in the few lines of the patch</li>
<li>Repeat the session, starting with adding tests to guarantee the behavior is preserved  (using mob programming)</li>
<li>Explain the technique of the golden master</li>
<li>Some more programming, until they start to see the light at the end of the tunnel</li>
<li>Small retrospective, including:

<ul>
<li>asking them their feelings when dealing with legacy code. The contents of this is pretty similar to the concepts that appear in the retrospectives, when talking about the legacy project / submodule.</li>
<li>what could I improve as facilitator or for the structure of the session</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>The repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/trivia-kata-spike">here</a>.</p>

<p>I prepared a small script:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">while test true; do
  git add --all;
  git commit --all -m "save process - uknown state";
  sleep 120;
done;
</code></pre>

<p>that saves the process and the progress, without disturbing the attendees. This allows you to follow the progress without any distraction. This idea was taken from a similar one from  <a href="http://twitter.com/@xav1uzz">Xavi Gost</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This same idea was also cited by someone else, if I recall correctly by Sandro Mancuso, saying that it would be a good idea to have a background git repository while working. IntelliJ IDEA already does something similar (and saves the events, e.g., when the tests are run, either red or green)</p>

<p>Cannot find the source, it was about having a script to commit automatically each time you run the tests; if it was red while refactoring, it would do git checkout (to revert); Was related to the noFlopSquad<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
