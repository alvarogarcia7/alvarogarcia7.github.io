<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=180283">this paper</a>, <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/180283/ICSE%202013-codereview.pdf">direct link</a>, by Alberto Bacchelli and Christian Bird on code review at Microsoft.</p>

<p>They explain how they do it, the exact methodology they are using and why they do it.</p>

<p>The main reasons to code review are:</p>

<ul>
<li>finding defects</li>
<li>code improvement</li>
<li>alternative solutions</li>
<li>knowledge transfer</li>
<li>team awareness and transparency</li>
<li>also:

<ul>
<li>improve development process</li>
<li>avoid build breaks</li>
<li>share code ownership</li>
<li>track rationale</li>
<li>team assessment</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>The quality wheel</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://blog.jessitron.com/2015/04/the-quality-wheel.html">this article</a> by Jessica Kerr about the qualities of beautiful code</p>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/21/what-legacy-code-is-about/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-21T22:09:54+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/21/what-legacy-code-is-about</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1429647115&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=legacy+code+feathers">Working effectively with legacy code</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mfeathers">Michael Feathers</a> describes:</p>

<blockquote><p>[&hellip;] legacy code as code without tests. It is a good working definition, and it points to a solution [&hellip;]</p>

<p>M Feathers, in the preface of Working effectively with legacy code</p></blockquote>

<p>I really like this definition. It is objective and measurable. But this is also a downside. Let&rsquo;s take any concurrent code, for example: you can achieve 100% coverage on a single thread and the program could have defects when executed in parallel. But this might be an outlier, as concurrency is difficult to test. Let&rsquo;s take another example.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s a imagine a non-concurrent (i.e., single thread) code composed by a single class (no collaborators; just one responsibility; it is &ldquo;Clean Code&rdquo;, as defined per R.C. Martin&rsquo;s book) that has some happy paths as well as some error-handling cases. As usual. The original code writer has decided to test only the happy paths. They deployed it to production, as the product was ready. You inherit this code.</p>

<p>After the system is deployed to production, you start receiving defect reports on the happy paths (the tested part). The first one, you cross it off as an one-time thing. Then the second and third come. You take a deeper look and start seeing some inconsistencies in the tests, some tests that actually do not test anything interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li>some test the test framework</li>
<li>some the language</li>
<li>some test a happy path that works by pure luck</li>
<li>some functionalities are tested (not all happy paths)</li>
<li>there&rsquo;s actually a defect converted into a specification (test) (??)</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, I ask myself this question: when did I start considering this code as legacy? When I saw the bug reports in production (several in a row) or when I saw the poor suite of tests?</p>

<p>I do think this codebase is legacy, no matter when I realized about it. But my first instinct would be to consider it legacy from the moment I received the bug reports, as I lost the trust in that code.</p>

<p>Because for me, <strong>legacy code is about trust, not tests</strong>. You can have tests but no trust; you can have trust but no tests (the latter is more difficult in non-trivial codebases.)</p>

<p>This is why I would like to update the definition:</p>

<blockquote><p>Legacy code is code without tests that provide trust to all your stakeholders</p></blockquote>

<p>The last part is very important, because the definition is no longer objective but depends from person to person. If the codebase doesn&rsquo;t have tests, it is definitely legacy. But even if it has them, would you consider the given example a legacy or non-legacy code?</p>

<p>These stakeholders include everyone affected or affecting the product: owners, developer team (in the scrum, wide sense), users, clients, &hellip;</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I&rsquo;ve written plenty of legacy code. Code which I thought was good but really wasn&rsquo;t. Even with tests, even with TDD, even with Clean Code. This has made me change my mind about what legacy code is all about.</p>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/02/21/a-legacy-code-introduction/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-21T20:05:46+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/02/21/a-legacy-code-introduction</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is one of the best legacy code introductions I&rsquo;ve seen:</p>

<blockquote><p>The Grand Redesign in the Sky</p>

<p>Eventually the team rebels. They inform management that they cannot continue to develop in this odious code base. They demand a redesign. Management does not want to expend the resources on a whole new redesign of the project, but they cannot deny that productivity is terrible. Eventually they bend to the demands of the developers and authorize the grand redesign in the sky.</p>

<p>A new tiger team is selected. Everyone wants to be on this team because it&rsquo;s a greenfield project. They get to start over and create something truly beautiful. But only the best and brightest are chosen for the tiger team. Everyone else must continue to maintain the current system.</p>

<p>Now the two teams are in a race. The tiger team must build a new system that does everything that the old system does. Not only that, they have to keep up with the changes that are continuously being made to the old system. Management will not replace the old system until the new system can do everything that the old system does.</p>

<p>This race can go on for a very long time. I&rsquo;ve seen it take 10 years. And by the time it&rsquo;s done, the original members of the tiger team are long gone, and the current members are demanding that the new system be redesigned because it&rsquo;s such a mess.</p>

<p><cite> Robert C. Martin </cite> in the chapter 1: Clean Code from the book by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Clean-Code-Handbook-Software-Craftsmanship/dp/0132350882/">the same name</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Also, why should you estimate the new tiger team abilities better than the old tiger team? Is it because the language, tools, or just because they are &ldquo;plain better&rdquo;?</p>

<p>What guarantees that the resulting software is going to be better than the old one?</p>

<p>Another interesting definition of legacy code is Michael Feather&rsquo;s one (code without tests).</p>
