    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Being A Developer After 40</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.com/being-a-developer-after-40-3c5dd112210c">this article</a> by Adrian Kosmaczewski on the required topics to be a developer at age 40 and keep enjoying it:</p>

<ul>

<li>Choose Your Galaxy Wisely</li>

<li>Keep on Learning</li>
<li>Teach</li>
<li>Workplaces Suck</li>
<li>Know Your Worth</li>

</ul>


<p>He references galaxy, the big stack you are positioned (JVM, .net, PHP, etc). He makes a special mention of the LLVM</p>

<blockquote><p>Take conscious decisions in your life. Be aware of your actions and their effect. Do not blush or be embarrased for changing your opinions. Say “I’m sorry” when required. Listen. Do not be a hotshot. Have integrity and self-respect.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Firing people</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://zachholman.com/talk/firing-people">this article</a> by Zach Holman on firing people at your current work, both from the perspective of the employee (fired), employer, coworker.</p>

<p>Also explains his personal experience of being fired from Github.</p>

<blockquote><p>You’ll know the difference between doing far and away your best work, and doing work that is still good, but just nominally better than what you’ve been doing. Once you catch yourself adjusting to that incremental progression… maybe it’s time to leave, to change things up</p></blockquote>
