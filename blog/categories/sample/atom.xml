    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h1>Types of defects</h1>

<p>Some time ago, while researching types of defects and the cost of fixing them<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, I stumbled upon this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Years ago I worked with a bunch of economists in the US Federal Government - they categorized &lsquo;bugs&rsquo; in their memos into three types:
 * Typos: Simple misspellings of words. Infrequent, easy to detect, easy to fix.
 * Writos: Incoherent sentences. More frequent, hard to detect, harder to fix.
 * Thinkos: Conceptually bonkers. Very frequent, subtle and hard to detect; almost impossible to fix.</p>

<p>Most &lsquo;late&rsquo; bugs that I&rsquo;ve seen in software projects belong in the last category - a lack of design or the failure to make a working mock-up leads to &lsquo;thinkos&rsquo; which are only obvious when the application is nearly completed. These are expensive to fix.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/story/03/10/21/0141215/software-defects---do-late-bugs-really-cost-more">http://developers.slashdot.org/story/03/10/21/0141215/software-defects&#8212;do-late-bugs-really-cost-more</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I would also add a new category to this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethos: Morally wrong, although possibly legal. These may take different forms: vary from a company to the next one,
from society to society, etc. Even harder to fix than &lsquo;thinkos&rsquo;,
as there is a reason (mainly economic) to keep them in place.</li>
</ul>


<p>  On a technical note,
  these are not usually well-known artifacts in the company, therefore not everyone
  should know about them. Only a few developers know the correct reasons behind them and
  the rest might be sold a fake reason, so the latter cannot fix these &lsquo;ethos&rsquo;, as they
  assume they are present for a good reason</p>

<p>This is also a chapter in the book <a href="https://leanpub.com/leprechauns">The Leprechauns of Software Engineering</a> by Laurent Bossavit: &lsquo;Chapter 10: The cost of defects: an illustrated history&rsquo;<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/21/annotations-and-aspects-in-java/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-21T07:23:23+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/21/annotations-and-aspects-in-java</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve written a sample project with an annotation and an aspect to intercept it and decorate it.</p>

<p>The code provides a way of doing <code>try|catch</code>, specifying an exception to be caught.</p>

<p>The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/annotation-aspect-java">here</a></p>

<h2>In the process</h2>

<p>This has taken me approximately one hour to prepare the spike and half more to refactor and massage a bit.</p>

<p>If you want to see the raw details, the refactor has been committed step by step (the spike hasn&rsquo;t). The unmassaged code can be found <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/annotation-aspect-java/tree/d5e61ca56a38b1611c9acaa61a2e169b14d19d1e">here</a>. The massaged version is at the <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/annotation-aspect-java/">tip of the arrow</a></p>

<h2>More information</h2>

<p>Regarding <code>annotations</code> (like @Override):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/">This official article</a> on annotations is useful.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaAnnotations/article.html">This article</a> by Lars Vogel guides you step by step.</li>
<li><a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/annotations.html">This article</a> by Jakov Jenkov is very nice.</li>
<li><a href="http://crunchify.com/understanding-java-annotation-annotation-examples/">This article</a> helps you to understand what an annotation is and what to use it for.</li>
</ul>


<p>Regarding <code>aspect</code> (based on AspectJ):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14714092/spring-3-2-aop-intercepting-methods-by-annotation">This question</a> has been my main source of information / inspiration for the spring + aspectj configuration</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>One of the drawbacks that I find to common examples or tutorials is that they&rsquo;re not complete. They show you part of the information, but not the whole. While this helps most of the readers, there are library incompatibilities, defects, specific versions, etc. This is why I like to post the whole solution, including <code>pom.xml</code> (dependencies) and tests.</p>

<p>Having less documentation for developers can be acceptable if you have tests / more tests; of course, as long as other developers can follow your thought while developing.</p>
