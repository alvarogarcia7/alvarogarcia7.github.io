    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A quote from <a href="http://www.reinventingorganizations.com">Reinventing Organizations</a>,
about roles, job descriptions and job titles in Chapter 2.2:
Self-management (structures), page 90:</p>

<blockquote><p> [In] Teal Organizations [&hellip;] people are not made to fit pre-defined jobs;
 their job emerge from a multitude of roles and responsibilities they pick
 up based on their interests, talents, and the needs of the organization.
- Frederic Laloux, Reinventing Organizations</p></blockquote>

<p>In my opinion, this is the role of the software consultant when working with a client:
even if the customer has asked for help in some parts of their activity, a senior-enough
consultant can discover other areas where they can add value, even if that new
work doesn&rsquo;t have much in common with the initlal request (this change should
be approved by the people that will be affected).</p>

<p>This is also a thought that <a href="https://twitter.com/@mashooq">Mash</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/@sandromancuso">Sandro</a> were discussing lately.</p>
