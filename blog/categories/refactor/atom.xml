    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I went to the Jason Gorman&rsquo;s TDD workshop (experience report <a href="../../../../2015/04/12/jason-gorman-tdd-intensive-workshop">here</a>), he said something interesting regarding refactor and TDD:</p>

<blockquote><p>In job offers / advertisements, TDD is much more in demand than refactor. But the latter is included in the former as an integral part.</p>

<p>Jason Gorman</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with the second thought: you cannot properly do TDD without refactoring, as it is an integral part; also the third phase.</p>

<p>For me, sometimes refactoring is the difference between code and &ldquo;Clean Code&rdquo; (as defined in the book by the same title). If I cannot find the (algorithmic) pattern for the software I&rsquo;m writing, I try to introduce scaffolds to keep investigating until I can find a viable, general solution (if the problem requires it.)</p>

<p>Even after doing the refactor <code>replace algorithm</code>, the code might not have the responsibilities in the right place, the methods might be long, value objects not extracted yet, etc. This is where further refactor is needed to introduce all those qualities in the piece of software.</p>

<p>I believe that we programmers have done a bad job of communicating with the rest of the organization what refactoring is about. It has nothing to do with beauty, style or design (in the visual sense) but is related to maintainability, coupling, defects and quality. Money, in the long run, as its objective is to make it cheaper to change in the future, a better investment and ROI. This is the common language that the rest of the company understands.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://twitter.com/@trikitrok">Manuel</a> has taught us today about the default value while destructuring:</p>

<blockquote><p>The following example illustrates the use of an :as directive to bind a local with the entire map.</p></blockquote>

<pre><code>user=&gt; (def point {:x 5 :y 7})
#'user/point

(let [{:keys [x y] :as the-point} point]
         (println "x:" x "y:" y "point:" the-point))

x: 5 y: 7 point: {:x 5, :y 7}
</code></pre>

<blockquote><p>We&rsquo;ve now seen the :as directive used for both vectors and maps. In both cases the local is always assigned to the entire expression that is being destructured.</p></blockquote>

<p><a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2010/07/clojure-destructuring.html">Source</a></p>

<p>This has been used for a method like this one:</p>

<pre><code class="lisp">(defn all-access[k]
  (do (:a k))
  (do (:b k)))
</code></pre>

<p>this has been refactored to this</p>

<pre><code class="lisp">(defn all-access[k]
  (let [{:keys [a b] :as k}]
      (do a)
      (do (:b k))))
</code></pre>

<p>the best thing about this is I can introduce the keys to the array while keeping the original map (<code>k</code>) and, when I&rsquo;m ready, to change some of the accesses to <code>k</code> to its destructured variables.</p>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/03/31/trimming-your-plants/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-31T23:13:45+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/03/31/trimming-your-plants</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post belongs to the <a href="/blog/categories/growing-software">growing-software series</a></p>

<p>Imagine this situation: the code works. You are at <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/refactoring_a-first-example/commit/1ff7df4d45ee1ac5bc483b90da7ed1b68f27aef9">this stage</a></p>

<p>Disregarding the tests, the production code is complete. Could be better, but it is ready if you are in a hurry.</p>

<p>Now, picture your test as a plant in a plant pot: it might be healthy on the outside (external quality) but how are their roots (internal quality)?</p>

<p>Do you imagine them in an ordered fashion or in a jungle of roots? Everything on the outside is connected to one or several roots? In case it is several, what / how much do they share?</p>

<h2>Trimming the roots</h2>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s imagine you want to put the plant in a different plant pot. You don&rsquo;t want the plant to be altered in any way: keep producing fruits as it was before, as green and shiny, etc. Just alter the container for business reasons.</p>

<p>The more tidy and organized the roots are related to the outside plant itself, the easier it is to reshape (or refactor) it.</p>

<p>So this is exactly what refactoring is about: &ldquo;keeping the same external behaviour, modifying the internal structure&rdquo;. I like to explain as &ldquo;modify how it is done but not what it does&rdquo;.</p>

<p>When you trim the roots but leave unaltered the top, you are making it cheaper to modify the internal shape without affecting the rest. The plant will continue to grow, requiring more and more nutrients from the ground. Small increases that do not warrant a bigger plant pot, as the current one can withstand the new requirements.</p>

<p>This is where the analogy is no longer useful: when writing software, you&rsquo;re also making it easier to reuse, modify and maintain.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The more tidied up you have your plants, the cheaper to maintain and modify.</p>

<p>Software implementation details are like roots: they expand to find any small hole where to expand. Even to scaffold expected behaviour</p>

<p>Trim your plants early and often, always with the help of a test suite</p>
