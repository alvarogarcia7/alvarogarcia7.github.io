    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Yesterday, <a href="http://twitter.com/@trikitrok">Manuel Rivero</a> and I facilitated a <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Barcelona-Software-Craftsmanship/events/221463037/">workshop</a> using the <a href="https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/tree/master/TDDMicroExercises/Java/TirePressureMonitoringSystem">tire pressure</a> TDD microexercise. (More microexercises can be found in <a href="/blog/categories/microexercise">this category</a>, also <a href="https://github.com/lucaminudel/TDDwithMockObjectsAndDesignPrinciples/tree/master/TDDMicroExercises">here</a>)</p>

<p>We scheduled the session as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>10 minutes introduction to the exercise</li>
<li>10 minutes to download the code and take a first look</li>
<li>10 minutes explanation about the exercise, what the problem is, etc</li>
<li>30 minutes for the attendees to explore the solution (on their own)</li>
<li>10 minutes for commenting the explored solutions, comments about it</li>
<li>40 minutes of prepared kata format</li>
<li>10 minutes of final explanations, questions and answers (Q&amp;A)</li>
</ul>


<p>Total: 120 minutes or two hours, approximately</p>

<p>We decided that one would be mostly at the keyboard and the other mostly explaining. This allows for the speaker to introduce some concepts while the driver is performing a larger refactor / step.</p>

<p>Some of our own feedback:</p>

<ul>
<li>Have the kata prepared, clear all your doubts before doing it live</li>
<li>Be very specific about the goal of the kata: the narrower the focus, the more we will learn</li>
<li>If necessary, exercise your shortcuts / practices one last time</li>
<li>Set up the font as big as needed. Even remove some whitelines (present in your usual code) so more text can fit in the screen.</li>
<li>It was very useful for us to have a small script of what we would perform: what was the idea, where to stop to explain things, etc</li>
<li>A prepared kata is a show (like a movie), so the dialogs between the performing pair are important. Do not be afraid to tell the reasons why you did this last refactor.</li>
<li>Answer the questions as you go, do not wait until the end of the session</li>
</ul>


<p>Some feedback we received:</p>

<ul>
<li>It would have been useful to do a recap at the end of the session, to refresh the most important concepts</li>
<li>In general the session was good, they were satisfied with the techniques shown there</li>
<li>The exercise was concise and small, perfect for two hours' time</li>
</ul>


<p>Many thanks to all the attendees and to Manuel: I learnt a lot from the session and renewed my energies to keep doing these workshop sessions. Also thanks to Luca Minudel for writing these awesome exercises.</p>
