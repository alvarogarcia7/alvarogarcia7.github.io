<h2>Why you should never, ever, ever use MongoDB</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://cryto.net/~joepie91/blog/2015/07/19/why-you-should-never-ever-ever-use-mongodb/">this article</a> stating the downsides of using MongoDB. Written by Sven Slootweg</p>

<h2>Do you really get classloaders?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/rebel-labs-tutorial-do-you-really-get-classloaders/">this video</a> by Jevgeny Kabanov on classloaders: what they are, how they work nad some tips to solve common issues.</p>

<p>My notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the classloading is lazy: the resources are not loaded until they are mentioned</li>
<li>every classloader has a parent</li>
<li>every class has a classloader associated with it</li>
<li>every object has a class associated with it</li>
<li>classloading delegation: the parent is consulted before loading a class. if it has it, it will load it. If not, I will delegate it</li>
</ul>


<p>There is also <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2074396/core-java/javaone-2011--do-you-really-get-classloaders-.html">this article</a> on the same video</p>

<h2>7 lines of code, 3 minutes: Implement a programming language from scratch</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/implementing-a-programming-language/">this article</a> by Matt Might about the benefits of implementing a language (from scratch but on top of another existing language used as framework). Chooses lambda calculus as the desired DSL</p>

<h2>Turing completeness</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">this wikipedia article</a> (both main and discussion) about this subject.</p>

<p>It has sounded strange to me the reference to S-expressions:</p>

<blockquote><p>Data languages
The notion of Turing-completeness does not apply to languages such as XML, HTML, JSON, YAML and S-expressions because they are typically used to represent structured data, not describe computation [&hellip;]</p></blockquote>

<p>If data (S-expression) is represented as the same format as code (e.g., Lisp&rsquo;s S-expression) and the latter is used to represent a computation, shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;data languages that also are used as computation languages&rdquo; excluded from that list?</p>

<p>As a side note, Lisp is Turing Complete (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness#Examples">Turing Complete#Examples</a>)</p>

<h2>The Prize Is Won; The Simplest Universal Turing Machine Is Proved</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://blog.wolfram.com/2007/10/24/the-prize-is-won-the-simplest-universal-turing-machine-is-proved/?year=2007&amp;monthnum=10">this article</a> by Stephen Wolfram about the proof of a Turing Machine 2,3 being universal by Alex Smith.</p>

<h2>No increment operator (++) in Ruby?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/3717519/no-increment-operator-in-ruby">this stackoverflow</a> question about the lack of post-increment operator (i++) in Ruby:</p>

<blockquote><p>++ and &ndash; are NOT reserved operator in Ruby.</p>

<h2>Code is Data, Data is Code</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://blogs.mulesoft.com/dev/news-dev/code-is-data-data-is-code/">this article</a> by James Donelan on the equivalence of code and data in homoiconic languages, including Clojure.</p>

<p>The article talks about homoiconicity, manually creating Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) out of data and the macro environment. Also, compares the difference between macros and functions.</p>

<h2>Agile in Practice: Test Driven Development</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uGaNkTahrIw">this video</a> introducing TDD by the Agile Academy. Explains its motivations and the basic cyclical fashion.</p>

<h2>Agile in Practice: Pair Programming</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ET3Q6zNK3Io">this video</a> by Agile Academy on practicing pair programming. Explains the destination and how to get there.</p>

<h2>A low cost approach to working on side projects</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://practicingruby.com/articles/low-cost-approach-to-side-projects">this article</a> by Gregory Brown on how to apply the MVP and Lean Startup principles to side projects (a.k.a. pet projects). Try to start with a brainstorming session of all the features you want your product to have, then prioritise, picking the most important ones.</p>

<p>Most projects' needs can be solved with a minimal version, in the form of a script that took half an hour to develop.</p>

<h2>Extreme Programming</h2>

<h2>Disruptor: High performance alternative to bounded queues for exchanging data between concurrent threads</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://lmax-exchange.github.io/disruptor/files/Disruptor-1.0.pdf">this white paper</a> describing the disruptor framework: a way of exchanging data between concurrent threads.</p>

<p>It uses a ring buffer and other techniques to eliminate write contention, reduce read contention and produces good results. It was developed for a financial exchange environment but it&rsquo;s general purpose.</p>

<h2>Dissecting the Disruptor: What&rsquo;s so special about a ring buffer?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://mechanitis.blogspot.com.es/2011/06/dissecting-disruptor-whats-so-special.html">this article</a> about the ring buffer data structure. A FIFO data structure where elements get overwritten to reduce pressure on the garbage collector. Every message gets sent to every consumer.</p>

<h2>The Dependency Inversion Principle</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.objectmentor.com/resources/articles/dip.pdf">this paper</a> about the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) written Robert C. Martin.</p>

<p>It explains the theory, philosophy behind it. Also, creates an example with a copy buffer and different output locations</p>

<h2>DIP in the Wild</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/dipInTheWild.html">this article</a> about the Dependency Inversion Principle (DIP) written by Brett L. Schuchert.</p>

<p>It is explained non-canonical representations of this principle, how in other cases he has solved it and conclusions of using it day to day.</p>

<h2>The New New Product Development Game</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://hbr.org/1986/01/the-new-new-product-development-game">this paper</a> about the holistic approach to product development, considered seminal for Scrum and other Agile methodologies. Written by Hirotaka Takeuchi and Ikujiro Nonaka</p>

<p>In it, they describe how teams are distributed, the responsibilities for each one, and the degrees of freedom.</p>

<p>Cites the six basic characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>built-in instability</li>
<li>self-organizing project teams</li>
<li>overlapping development phases</li>
<li>multilearning</li>
<li>subtle control</li>
<li>organizational transfer of learning</li>
</ul>
