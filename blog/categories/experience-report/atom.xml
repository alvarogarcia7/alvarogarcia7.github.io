    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One month ago (on November 15th) I facilitated my first <a href="http://globalday.coderetreat.org/">Global Day of Code Retreat</a> at <a href="http://www.ebayenterprise.com/contact/locations.php">eBay Enterprise International</a> and had such a blast. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Barcelona-Meetup/events/218211672/">Link to the event (Spanish)</a></p>

<h2>Some thoughts</h2>

<p>After a month of thinking about it, here are some thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This year&rsquo;s GDCR was quite different that last one&rsquo;s:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s OK: do not strive for repeating the same each year</p></li>
<li><p>Heat map (in several dimensions): TDD x language</p>

<p>Usually meetups have a clear goal, for the limited amount of time they run (see another bullet point).</p>

<p>This single goal can span across multiple skill sets (e.g., TDD and language specific), therefore we did a two-dimensional heat map: first dimension is TDD skill level and second dimension (discreet) would be language you master</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LRmjLbvFEtqDskDwb3gVBKDfXckqDylAMJA7HB6ZLC8/edit">Example can be found here</a></p></li>
<li><p>As a facilitator, have a clear goal for the meetup, even though you don&rsquo;t need to share it with the assistants</p>

<p>Mine was to have fun and introduce some people to TDD</p>

<p>I shared the goal with the attendants because I wanted to explain the purpose of that day to newcomers.</p>

<p>Also, as a result of that day, I&rsquo;ve discovered some very motivated people in our host (eBay). Personally, I&rsquo;d like to continue doing meetups with their developers.</p></li>
<li><p>You need a mix of more seasoned attendants and more unexperienced ones.</p>

<p>This way, the knowledge is being transferred both ways; not only about the language but about strategies, patterns, shortcuts &amp; editors, languages, etc</p>

<p>If doing TDD in these events, it&rsquo;s even more important to mix people, as it&rsquo;s difficult for an unexperienced pair to start doing TDD for themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>You should only do your job as facilitator</p>

<p>Let others discuss, ask and answer questions. Your job should be as thin as possible. Don&rsquo;t try to answer too many questions</p>

<p>There will be attendants with more experience / expertise than you (most of them were in my case), so don&rsquo;t strive to teach them but to manage the discussions to the right place</p>

<p>Be strict about timing but find the balance. Sometimes it&rsquo;s useful to invest more time (~5 minutes) to a rich discussion and then reduce the next iteration.</p>

<p>Many people will complain about having to delete their code the first time. Explain to them that&rsquo;s part of the game and don&rsquo;t give in. The following iterations most of the people won&rsquo;t complain anymore</p>

<p>Last but not least, have fun!</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Some critiques</h2>

<p>We organized the event a little bit late</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The difference from last year (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Barcelona-Meetup/events/153967432/">December</a>) vs this year (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Barcelona-Meetup/events/218211672/">November</a>) was relevant. We were expecting to do it later so it surprised us.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to that, many people couldn&rsquo;t come and I&rsquo;m sorry for it</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We totally, definitely should do this more often.</p>

<p>You need to reinvent yourself for every global day or people will stop coming</p>
