    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Update: I&rsquo;ve grouped all small posts related to the self-study from May 2015
into a single post</p>

<h2>Programmer passion considered harmful</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://medium.com/on-coding/programmer-passion-considered-harmful-5c5d4e3a9b28">this article</a> on why programmer passion could be negative. The title is similar to a paper by Dijkstra.</p>

<h2>Software Craftsmanship: Are Bootcamps Enough?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://www.coursereport.com/blog/software-craftsmanship-are-bootcamps-enough">this article</a> on software craftsmanship, development bootcamps and passion by <a href="https://twitter.com/kauerrolemodel">Ken Auer</a></p>

<h2>Improve your development environments with virtualization</h2>

<p>I have seen this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Dg_vPMnC7_k&amp;feature=youtu.be">Improve your development environments with virtualization</a> by Luke Sneeringer.</p>

<p>My notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>development should be exactly like production.</li>
<li>except where it is too painful. there it should be different</li>
</ul>


<h2>Buffer&rsquo;s take on values</h2>

<p>I have found these <a href="http://www.slideshare.net/Bufferapp/buffer-culture-04">values</a>, written by Buffer, very interesting.</p>

<h2>Public static void</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5kj5ApnhPAE">&ldquo;Public, static void&rdquo;</a> by Rob Pike. The slides can be found <a href="http://www.oscon.com/oscon2010/public/schedule/detail/13423">here</a></p>

<h3>My notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>too much bureaucracy</li>
<li>fighting the compiler</li>
<li>dynamic vs static typing</li>
<li>language too verbose</li>
<li><p>do not mix the two of them</p></li>
<li><p>a language niche:</p>

<ul>
<li>comprehensible</li>
<li>statically typed</li>
<li>light on the page</li>
<li>fast to work in</li>
<li>scales well</li>
<li>doesn&rsquo;t require tools but supports them well</li>
<li>good at networking and multiprocessing</li>
</ul>


<p>(minute 10:09)​</p></li>
<li><p><a href="http://golang.org">Go</a> was born to fill this niche</p></li>
</ul>

<h2>Learn You Some Lisp for Great Good</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the video <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3T00X_sNg4Q">Learn You Some Lisp for Great Good</a>, by Howard Abrams.</p>

<p>I guess this is a reference to the popular <a href="http://learnyouahaskell.com/">Learn You a Haskell for Great Good!</a>.</p>

<p>He suggests many interesting resources for learning Lisp dialects. The live coding is in Clojure:</p>

<li><a href="http://clojurekoans.com/">Clojure Koans</a></li>
</ul>


<p>On another topic, in the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/ClojureBCN/events/222418104/">Bank accounts exercise from Exercism</a> meetup, we discussed the book <a href="https://pragprog.com/book/shcloj2/programming-clojure">Programming Clojure (2nd edition)</a> by Stuart Halloway</p>

<h2>Professor Frisby&rsquo;s Mostly Adequate Guide to Functional Programming</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://github.com/DrBoolean/mostly-adequate-guide">this guide</a> to functional programming. It is still work in progress (WIP) but still interesting. Written in javascript, so you can REPL in the browser.</p>

<h2>Learning Code Good</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched this video, by Saron Yitbarek: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nsnAYRqYLA">Learn Code Good</a>.</p>

<h2>Why You Don&rsquo;t Get Mock Objects</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=R9FOchgTtLM">Why You Don&rsquo;t Get Mock Objects</a>, by Gregory Moeck.</p>

<p>In it, they point to the <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/">Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests</a> book (<a href="/{{site.category_dir}}/goos">category here</a>), the paper <a href="www.jmock.org/oopsla2004.pdf">Mock Roles, not Objects</a> (also present in the GOOS book).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/tech-debt-repayment">this article</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/@jeremyjarrell">Jeremy Jarrell</a> on technical debt how to repay it: schedule, taxes, default, etc</p>

<p>This has made me think of the <a href="http://scbcn.ideascale.com/a/dtd/Deuda-t%C3%A9cnica-origen-y-consecuencias/69782-25568">&ldquo;Deuda técnica, origen y consecuencias&rdquo; talk</a> (Technical debt: origin and consequences) (Spanish), that was delivered by <a href="https://twitter.com/@jgomezz">Javier Gómez</a> at the Software Craftsmanship 2014.</p>

<h2>Revisiting XP: be a thoughtful programmer by exercising more collective ownership</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.infoq.com/articles/revisit-p-collective">this article</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/tiagooo_romero">Tiago Garcia</a> on the collective code ownership, as stated by Xtreme Programming (XP), with some example and guidelines.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://ronjeffries.com/articles/2015-03-01-testing-in-sprints/">this article</a> by Ron Jeffries.</p>

<p>Discusses the need for testing and why this hasn&rsquo;t been communicated enough, as there still are people who have not understood it.</p>

<p>Also about why people equal something failing when using scrum with scrum failing.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.carlosble.com/2015/05/dto-vs-domain-models/">this article</a> by Carlos Blé</p>

<h2>Homoiconicity isn’t the point</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://calculist.org/blog/2012/04/17/homoiconicity-isnt-the-point/">this article</a> by David Herman about homoiconicity, comparing Lisp dialects (have it) to others that don&rsquo;t. The main point is at the end, where it says:</p>

<blockquote><p>[&hellip;] homoiconicity isn’t the point, read is</p></blockquote>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/03/31/trimming-your-plants/"/>
    <updated>2015-03-31T23:13:45+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/03/31/trimming-your-plants</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This post belongs to the <a href="/{{site.category_dir}}/growing-software">growing-software series</a></p>

<p>Imagine this situation: the code works. You are at <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/refactoring_a-first-example/commit/1ff7df4d45ee1ac5bc483b90da7ed1b68f27aef9">this stage</a></p>

<p>Disregarding the tests, the production code is complete. Could be better, but it is ready if you are in a hurry.</p>

<p>Now, picture your test as a plant in a plant pot: it might be healthy on the outside (external quality) but how are their roots (internal quality)?</p>

<p>Do you imagine them in an ordered fashion or in a jungle of roots? Everything on the outside is connected to one or several roots? In case it is several, what / how much do they share?</p>

<h2>Trimming the roots</h2>

<p>Now, let&rsquo;s imagine you want to put the plant in a different plant pot. You don&rsquo;t want the plant to be altered in any way: keep producing fruits as it was before, as green and shiny, etc. Just alter the container for business reasons.</p>

<p>The more tidy and organized the roots are related to the outside plant itself, the easier it is to reshape (or refactor) it.</p>

<p>So this is exactly what refactoring is about: &ldquo;keeping the same external behaviour, modifying the internal structure&rdquo;. I like to explain as &ldquo;modify how it is done but not what it does&rdquo;.</p>

<p>When you trim the roots but leave unaltered the top, you are making it cheaper to modify the internal shape without affecting the rest. The plant will continue to grow, requiring more and more nutrients from the ground. Small increases that do not warrant a bigger plant pot, as the current one can withstand the new requirements.</p>

<p>This is where the analogy is no longer useful: when writing software, you&rsquo;re also making it easier to reuse, modify and maintain.</p>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>The more tidied up you have your plants, the cheaper to maintain and modify.</p>

<p>Software implementation details are like roots: they expand to find any small hole where to expand. Even to scaffold expected behaviour</p>

<p>Trim your plants early and often, always with the help of a test suite</p>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2014/12/29/should-we-start-the-tdd-cycle-on-refactor/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-29T20:30:01+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2014/12/29/should-we-start-the-tdd-cycle-on-refactor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In this lexical scope, TDD by example is referring to this book<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, available <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-By-Example/dp/0321146530">on Amazon</a></p>

<h3>The TDD cycle</h3>

<p>Altough <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck">Kent Beck</a> in his book Test-Driven Development by example explains in &ldquo;Part I: the money example&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> that one should</p>

<blockquote><p>quickly add a test;</p>

<p>run all the tests and see the new one fail [&hellip;]</p>

<p><cite>Kent Beck </cite></p></blockquote>

<p>Implying that the TDD cycle starts with the red. Later on he explains that the cycle continues with green and refactor and back to red.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve been hearing for a while that there&rsquo;re some useful refactors to be done before introducing new code. Rings in my head but the only example I have is Xavi Gost&rsquo;s &ldquo;La economía del refactoring<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Refactoring</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the definition of refactor (found <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/">here</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p>[Refactoring] is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior.</p>

<p> <cite>Martin Fowler</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found some info on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1355101/test-code-refactor-when-should-we-start-a-refactoring">stackoverflow</a> about the subject. The currently <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1355782">accepted answer</a> points out some interesting comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not refactor on red. Always a good reminder</li>
<li>If you are refactoring for introducing a feature, how much refactor is enough? This is speculative development, possibly taking much time from needed development</li>
</ul>


<p>The last point is the one that interests me the most:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your refactoring might not be where you&rsquo;re going to introduce new production code<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> (spatial caché)</li>
<li>You might end up introducing features after a few hours/days of refactoring, therefore losing focus on the refactor you did and why (local caché)</li>
<li>Given that I&rsquo;ve already &ldquo;cleaned up&rdquo; this, I could also go somewhere else (slippery slope). Heard from <a href="https://twitter.com/xav1uzz">Xavi Gost</a> at the CAS2014 at his talk <a href="http://cas2014.agile-spain.org/sessions/sesion-1h-la-economia-del-refactoring-una-vision-desde-la-gestion-economica-del-proyecto-xavier-gost/">La economía del refactoring</a></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>No está justificado hacer cambios fuera de la rebanada.</p></blockquote>

<p>Roughly translated to &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not justified to change outside the bread slice&rdquo;, as Xavi was referring to software as sliced bread instead of layers, vertical rather than horizontal</p>

<h3>Should you do it?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Doing it would be a good thing, as long as you know in advance what will be affected by the next feature.</li>
<li>It can allow for less refactoring at the end of the cycle. This is not about duplication but refactoring to patterns. There might be a gain in refactoring to a pattern before introducing another feature. An example might be adding a new strategy when it&rsquo;s currently coded as if-then-else</li>
<li>The last responsible moment might be before or after introducing the feature. You decide.</li>
<li>Work less as there&rsquo;s no need for adding new cases to old structures and then simplifying</li>
</ul>


<h3>Should you not do it?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Foreseeing the future is difficult, therefore you might end with unused development, as it is speculating</li>
<li>Related to the last point, you might end refactoring in the wrong places. There&rsquo;s no current business value to it.</li>
<li>Not useful on first round of a new feature, you can use a lambda transition to the red again. But then, this is not a general pattern, only applicable to a big percent of cases.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Short answer: it mainly depends on your environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>You: experience, common sense (sadly) &mdash;another post coming&mdash;, benefit/time-wasted ratio</li>
<li>Your project: how tight are deadlines, how critical that code is, the team&rsquo;s pressure</li>
</ul>


<p>Long answer: Yes, as long as:
 1. You realize there is a fine line between fixing code and rewriting code (Egoless programming #4). Don&rsquo;t be a lone enforcer
 2. Strictly follow the boy scout rule but only around your campfire, not outside of it.
 1. You know your domain, pitfalls and team well
 1. You want to test this hypothesis and post an answer</p>
