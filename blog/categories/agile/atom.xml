</ul>


<h3>Feedback systems</h3>

<ul>
<li>Open (no) feedback system, such as timed sprinklers</li>
<li>Closed feedback system</li>
<li>Output only system</li>
</ul>


<h3>Why everything is software</h3>

<ul>
<li>Examples of everything is software</li>
<li>Software is eating the world</li>
<li>Even hardware is modeled as software</li>
</ul>


<h3>Modeling as a Finite State Machine (FSM)</h3>

<ul>
<li>There&rsquo;s memory in the feedback loop. See the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Finite-state_machine">finite state machine</a></li>
<li>A lesson from &ldquo;World War Z&rdquo;: &ldquo;When nine people agree on something, it&rsquo;s the tenth man&rsquo;s responsibility to disagree no matter how improbable the idea&rdquo;. &ldquo;You don&rsquo;t believe your own [ideas]&rdquo;. There&rsquo;s an article <a href="http://lifehacker.com/plan-more-effectively-with-the-tenth-man-rule-1689738373">here</a> and <a href="http://evidencemag.com/world-war-z/">here</a>, but they don&rsquo;t cite any official source related to this. The second one cites World War Z again, so it might be <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias">confirmation bias</a>.</li>
<li>Test in production (e.g., <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy/wiki/Chaos-Monkey">chaos monkey</a> from Netflix) rather than doing TDD</li>
<li>No evidence of TDD as effective, he sees it as waste</li>
<li>Move fast and break things</li>
</ul>


<h3>About layered organizations</h3>

<ul>
<li>Layered architecture. Examples: OSI, Catholic Church, Army</li>
<li>Analogy: Software development as a professional team structure (also cited from Netflix)</li>
<li>Book: Creativity from Constraints: the psychology of breakthrough. Focus, constraint, creativity</li>
<li>Presentation: <a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/Developing-Expertise-Dave-Thomas">Developing Expertise: Herding Racehorses, Racing Sheep</a></li>
<li>Analogy: Developers are like junkies, we want to be high all the time</li>
<li>Answering a new proposal: instead of &ldquo;no, but&rdquo; (black hat), &ldquo;yes and&rdquo; (blue hat). Reference to <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Bossypants-Tina-Fey-ebook/dp/B0047Y0FGY">Bossypants</a> by Tina Fey</li>
<li>Your knives, your tools. &ldquo;How can we make millions if we don&rsquo;t value our tools?&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<p>About software:</p>

<blockquote><p>software will take over the world, and developers are the ones who make it happen.</p></blockquote>

<p>About methodologies:</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Programming, motherfucker. Do you speak it?&rdquo; (<a href="http://programming-motherfucker.com/">Source</a>)</p></blockquote>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today we&rsquo;ve discussed about code reviews on <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Barcelona-Software-Craftsmanship/events/220293683/">this open space</a></p>

<h2>Notes</h2>

<p>These are my notes, in no particular order:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce information silos all around the company, as everyone [technical] can participate in these events</li>
<li>raise the &ldquo;just arrived&rdquo; people&rsquo;s knowledge [Difficult to hit the ground up and running, but these code review sessions can help]</li>
<li>invest one person as &lsquo;sheriff&rsquo; for the sprint: they will take care of static analysis tools (such as sonar) and continuous integration (CI; such as jenkins). They will make sure others follow the working agreements</li>
<li>In the academic environment, some teams do share their patches via mailing lists and this makes it much slower to adapt and review changes [As compared to an on-line sharing system - like web-based interfaces to distributed version control systems] As this team doesn&rsquo;t have a CI tool, they must test it / try it manually before reviewing the code.</li>
<li>Pair programming does not remove the need for code review [This has been surfaced twice]</li>
<li>Your work is not more important than your team members&#8217; one. [Related to not having time to code review]</li>
<li>Do code reviews include architecture? [We&rsquo;ve agreed that the architecture to some degree should be discussed before code reviews]</li>
<li>&ldquo;Troll review&rdquo;</li>
<li>Anyone can veto pull requests [By opening a question; do not allow for pull requests to be closed with open questions]</li>
<li>A 15-minute time slot everyday to code review [As code hygiene; Done right after lunch,  breakfast or just before leaving, when you&rsquo;re tired]</li>
<li>Code review tasks have higher priority than other tasks [Do not take other tasks if there are code reviews to do]</li>
<li>Code reviews put a lot of pressure so people learn and the knowledge level equalizes across the team</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p> My conclusions, even though some of them were not shared by everyone:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most of the people approve of code review practices: either they are doing them or are trying to apply them at their clients. (Warning: this was a code review meetup, so there&rsquo;s a bias: people not interested in them won&rsquo;t come). No one was against doing them.</li>
<li>Code reviews have a cost, although it is beneficial to do them</li>
<li>Should your teammates not want to participate in the code review after agreeing on doing them, appeal to their professionalism / accountability, then to their time (stated before), then troll them: after a few (healthy) trolling code review sessions, people will feel more comfortable reviewing and being reviewed. Special mention to Miguel who coined (?)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> the term: troll review.</li>
<li>Great way of equalizing the (technical) knowledge level within the team</li>
<li>Great way of reduce information silos across the whole company</li>
<li>They can be fun if you do them properly</li>
<li>The need for code reviews do not disappear when pair programming: as long as you have a personal attachment to the code, you might not see its defects.</li>
</ul>

<li id="fn:1">
<p>after searching some ten minutes on the internet, there are only a couple of questions on meta.codereview stackoverflow, but not related to this. <strong>Update</strong>: In <a href="https://twitter.com/mallyvai/status/314260072798752768">here</a>, Vaibhav Mallya talks about a #trollReview, related to code. So, unfortunately, Miguel, you&rsquo;re not the first one. But there are fewer than 10 results on twitter.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
