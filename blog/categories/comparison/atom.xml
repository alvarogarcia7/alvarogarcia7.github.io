<h2>Habits For Effective Refactoring</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THw8t7ePlsc">this video</a> by Jason Gorman about techniques for effective and sustainable refactoring. Among them:</p>

<ul>
<li>check the tests, the coverage to make sure that the refactored code has a good safety net</li>
<li>set a refactoring goal: decide what you want to refactor at this time and when you&rsquo;ll be done</li>
<li>know your code smells</li>
<li>only refactor on green</li>
<li>use automated refactoring steps whenever possible: for the benefits of transactionability and undo are huge and the risk of messing it up decreases</li>
<li>commit after achieving the refactoring goal: allows to create a checkpoint to revert to</li>
<li>bottle the code smells for faster/better learning (in the commit message, he uses a hashtag for searching)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Show How, Don&rsquo;t Tell What - A Management Style</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://2ndscale.com/rtomayko/2012/management-style">this article</a> by Ryan Tomayko about the management style they apply at github:</p>

<blockquote><p>instead of telling them what to do, show people how to plan, build, and ship product together.</p>

<p>I’ve never actually told anyone what to do here. In fact, I vehemently refuse to tell people what to do. Here are just a couple reasons why:</p>

<p>I don’t scale. If I tell someone what to do and they do it, then what? Do I have to tell them another thing to do? What happens when I have to decide what to do for 20 people?</p>

<p>Telling people what to do is lazy. Instead, try to convince them with argument. This is how humans interact when there’s no artificial authority structure and it works great. If you can’t convince people through argument then maybe you shouldn’t be doing it.</p></blockquote>

<p>about managers:</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s often cited that GitHub doesn’t have managers. In my opinion, a better way to describe the phenomenon would be to say that everyone at GitHub is a manager</p></blockquote>

<p>Also explains the need for a reading compiler (e.g., for quick validation in the IDE), single-pass and multi-pass compiler.</p>

<p>They have built phases to transform the source code into bytecode, but to better use the cache locality, they programmatically mix phases using Java Reflection (metaprogramming) to traverse the tree (AST) once for these selected phases.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.pitheringabout.com/?p=830">this article</a> by Jon Pither about converting OO business rules into Clojure and using the homoiconicity for increasing the power: when code is data, the rules themselves become searchable (using a search engine), visualizable and analyzable. This wasn&rsquo;t possible before when code was not data.</p>

<p>They have also build further tools to analyze rules with larger sets of data, rather than unit tests, to see if they conflict among each other.</p>

<h2>8 Characteristics of Agile Software Developers</h2>

<p>​I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://medium.com/@pm_loop/8-characteristics-of-successful-agile-software-developers-ab2c43abb959">this article</a> that describes what characteristics are common in companies practicing an agile methodology, as revealed by a study (that even though it&rsquo;s not cited, can be tracked back to <a href="http://productdevelopmentsuccess.com/study">here</a>)</p>

<p>Suggests ideas for teams that change in a changing environment and what to do about it.</p>

<h2>This is why you never end up hiring good developers</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://qz.com/258066/this-is-why-you-dont-hire-good-developers/">this article</a> that explains what to look for in a strong, stronger, strongest (software) developer</p>

<p>The main idea is to find a good person that fits the job, without inflicting pain in the team morale and can learn to perform the specific tasks in the future, as (paraprasing) the pool of people that know what you need is much smaller than the people who can learn it.</p>

<p>The article specifies what to look and not look for in a candidate.</p>

<p>Some quotes:</p>

<blockquote><p>grasp of complex topics and the ability to clearly communicate about them, which are the two jobs of the working engineer.</p>

<p>track record of learning new skills and applying them successfully</p>

<p>TL;DR:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Many interview techniques test skills that are at best irrelevant to real working life;</p></li>
<li><p>you want somebody who knows enough to do the job right now;</p></li>
<li><p>or somebody smart and motivated enough that they can learn the job quickly;</p></li>
<li><p>you want somebody who keeps getting better at what they do;</p></li>
<li><p>your interview should be a collaborative conversations, not a combative interrogation;</p></li>
<li><p>you also want somebody who you will enjoy working with;</p></li>
<li><p>it’s important to separate “enjoy working with” from “enjoy hanging out with;”</p></li>
<li><p>don’t hire assholes, no matter how good they are;</p></li>
<li><p>if your team isn’t diverse, your team is worse than it needed to be;</p></li>
<li><p>accept that hiring takes a really long time and is really, really hard.</p></li>
</ol>

<h2>Volkswagen and Cheating Software</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2015/1015.html#1">this essay</a> by Bruce Schneier on cheating software, using as an example the Volkswagen case, but especially centered on software that is made do cheat in an undetectable fashion. Or that could be attributed to a programming mistake. The later, says the author, is so common that there could be already intentional or unintentional errors hiding cheating.</p>

<p>The author cites the Internet of Things of new opportunities for companies to use / produce cheating software and about a possible solution: transparency and oversight of the software that more and more reigns our lives.</p>

<p>Other (opinion) articles I&rsquo;ve read on the issue are:</p>

<h2>Broken windows theory</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">this wikipedia article</a> that talks about the broken windows theory, that states that controlling and monitoring public spaces leads to lowering the serious crimes.</p>

<p>Cites three causes for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Social norms and conformity</li>
<li>Lack of routing monitoring</li>
<li>Social signaling and signal crime</li>
</ul>


<p>Also discusses examples in the US and in the Netherlands, as well as criticisms.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read it to better understand how to apply this theory to software development, on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<h2>The Future of the LispM</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://arrdem.com/2014/11/28/the_future_of_the_lispm/">this article</a> explaining the past and current situation in the Lisp world: from Lisp, to LispM, to the MIT and Symbolics Inc., to Clojure and Scheme.</p>

<p>Also talks about integration with the operating system and its execution in the microprocessor. Written by Reid McKenzie</p>

<p>Tags: reid-mckenzie, lisp, lispm, clojure, scheme, symbolics</p>

<h2>The Lisp Curse</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html">this essay</a> by Rudolf Winestock, where he explains the low barrier (or low cost) for people in powerful languages (such as Lisp) to not accept the status quo in their project and fork / start their own.</p>

<p>It also compares languages and the people attracted to them. Cites Mark Tarver&rsquo;s essays several times, including the Brilliant Bipolar Mind (BBM) in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150308085419/http://www.lambdassociates.org/blog/bipolar.htm">this other</a> essay (from WebArchive). Compares the BBM and the normal worker in usefulness to companies.</p>

<p>Cites the Pareto principle (80-20 rule): a single hacker will port 80% the library from another language, leaving it buggy, undocumented and only understandable by the original author (assuming this is only 20% of the work). The rest (e.g., documentation, bugfixing, maintenance) are dropped and never taken care of.</p>

<p>Cites that this could be somewhat based on the facility of creating new features for the language. A small effort implies small implementation time, leaving no margin for thinking it through and seeing other corner cases. Also, a single person working on the project means no code review. The style might be coherent (always the same one), but might not be idiomatic, understandable by others, maintainable, etc.</p>

<p>Closes the essay with this quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>The expressive power of Lisp has drawbacks. There is no such thing as a free lunch.</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Bipolar Lisp Programmer</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150308085419/http://www.lambdassociates.org/blog/bipolar.htm">this essay</a> by Mark Tarver on the Bipolar Lisp programmmer or the koan of Lisp.</p>

<p>It explains the history of the Brilliant Bipolar Mind (BBM) when they attend high school and college. The freedom they&rsquo;re given, exactly the same as in Lisp, as you don&rsquo;t need to mix and socialize with others to create a good-enough solution.</p>

<p>In this fashion, he says, most of the projects are 80% finished, not documented, not maintained. The same problems that worry enterprises.</p>

<p>Cites the article &ldquo;Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tags: essay, mark-tarver, bipolar-lisp-programmer, lisp-programmer, programmer, brillian-bipolar-mind, blp, bbm, koan</p>

<p>My notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the classloading is lazy: the resources are not loaded until they are mentioned</li>
<li>every classloader has a parent</li>
<li>every class has a classloader associated with it</li>
<li>every object has a class associated with it</li>
<li>classloading delegation: the parent is consulted before loading a class. if it has it, it will load it. If not, I will delegate it</li>

<h2>7 lines of code, 3 minutes: Implement a programming language from scratch</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/implementing-a-programming-language/">this article</a> by Matt Might about the benefits of implementing a language (from scratch but on top of another existing language used as framework). Chooses lambda calculus as the desired DSL</p>

<h2>Turing completeness</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">this wikipedia article</a> (both main and discussion) about this subject.</p>

<p>It has sounded strange to me the reference to S-expressions:</p>

<blockquote><p>Data languages
The notion of Turing-completeness does not apply to languages such as XML, HTML, JSON, YAML and S-expressions because they are typically used to represent structured data, not describe computation [&hellip;]</p></blockquote>

<p>If data (S-expression) is represented as the same format as code (e.g., Lisp&rsquo;s S-expression) and the latter is used to represent a computation, shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;data languages that also are used as computation languages&rdquo; excluded from that list?</p>

<p>As a side note, Lisp is Turing Complete (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness#Examples">Turing Complete#Examples</a>)</p>

<ul>
<li>C++: function objects</li>
<li>Standard ML: generic implementation of interfaces. They allow to compose structures</li>
<li>Haskell: structure containing zero or more objects that can be converted to another structure containing the other objects. It&rsquo;s an homomorphism between two categories.</li>

<h2>Recursive Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/recursive-regular-expressions/">this article</a> on recursive regular expressions by Peteris Krumins.</p>

<p>In it, he lightly describes how a regular expression relates to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">Context-Free Grammar</a> and the language support for Perl to include recursive regular expressions. Based on the examples (e.g., <code>0^n1^n</code>), it really clicked to me that this could be expressed as a recursive function, with its base case and the recursive one. Also that it &ldquo;depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">wikipedia</a>)</p>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/08/13/searching-on-a-suite-of-failing-tests/"/>
    <updated>2015-08-13T14:45:19+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/08/13/searching-on-a-suite-of-failing-tests</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>Motivation</h2>

<p>Today, at a client, in the green phase, we had a test suite which was failing: the whole suite fails but the test cases, individually, succeed.</p>

<p>So my first impression was that something was being shared between tests. Also confirmed because the failing class was an EndToEnd test, in which we load the whole spring context</p>

<p>A quick glance was not revealing anything interesting, so I decided to find which is the minimum suite (as opposed as to the whole suite) that makes the new testcase fail, expecting to narrow the search for possible causes. This is very similar to what QuickCheck does, to generate the minimum testcase that breaks your property. In this way, you can focus in a possibly simpler<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> feature.</p>

<p>This post covers how to perform this search.</p>

<h2>Mathematical formulation</h2>

<p>Let <code>T</code> be a sequence of tests: <code>i1, i2, ..., in, F, j1, j2, ..., jm</code></p>

<p>where:
  * <code>i</code> are green tests
  *  <code>F</code> is first failing test
    * when executed in isolation, is green
    * when executed in the sequence, is red
  *  <code>j</code> are tests after the failed test.</p>

<p>In this case, the order is important, as the failed test suite (presumably) comes from a shared state set by a previous test.</p>

<p>The first search-space pruning is to remove the <code>j</code>, as they supposedly don&rsquo;t have any effect (as they are after the failed test)</p>

<p>let <code>T1</code> be a subsequence of <code>T</code> that includes <code>i</code> and <code>F</code>: <code>i1, i2, ..., in, F</code></p>

<p>Then it is assumed that one (or more) of the <code>i</code> generates an inconsistent state that makes <code>F</code> fail.</p>

<p>In the sequence <code>T1</code>, <code>F</code> fails, but in the sequence <code>TF</code> composed by <code>F</code> only, the test succeeds. This can be thought as the equivalent of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intermediate_value_theorem">Intermediate value theorem</a>, also called Bolzano&rsquo;s theorem, where the <code>T1</code> is at one side ot the axis and the <code>TF</code> at another. The theorem proves that there must be at least one value where the domain of the function crosses the axis</p>

<p>I say &ldquo;thought of&rdquo; because that theorem is only for continous functions and sets are not (are discrete) but the analogy is good enough: if one sequence is OK but the other isn&rsquo;t, there must be a minimum sequence where the result is OK and another one where the results are not. They two sequences must not be the same case as one result cannot be OK and not OK at the same time.</p>

<h2>Naïve search</h2>

<p>The first way of searching would be find the minimum set that fails:</p>

<ul>
<li>include <code>F</code>, then another from <code>i1,...,in</code> that makes the <code>F</code> fail. <code>F</code> the last one, because it needs to be affected by the side effects from the preceding test.</li>
<li>if the first strategy does not work, for each of the above cases, add another from the <code>i1,...,in</code> (except the one that was added)</li>
</ul>


<p>For the first step, it takes <code>O(n * 2)</code>, assuming executing a single test costs <code>O(1)</code>. Reduces to <code>O(n)</code></p>

<p>For the second step, <code>O(n * n-1 * 3)</code>. Reduces to <code>O(n^2)</code></p>

<p>For the third step, <code>O(n * n-1 * n-2 * 4)</code>. Reduces to <code>O(n^3)</code></p>

<p>For the nth step, it costs <code>O(n * n-1 * n-2 * ... * n-(n-1) * (n+1))</code>. Reduces to <code>O(n^n)</code>. Which is polynomical but not feasible for medium-sized <code>n</code> (in an automatic fashion) or small <code>n</code> (in a manual fashion)</p>

<h2>Dichotomous search</h2>

<p>(This is also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm">binary search</a>)</p>

<p>Inspired by <code>git-bisect</code>, I decided to treat the sequence <code>i1, ..., in</code> as the source for the dicotomical search, applying the subsequences to <code>F</code>.</p>

<p>The first step, it takes <code>O(n/2 * n/2)</code> = <code>O(n^2)</code> to execute half the tests</p>

<p>The second step, is to execute half the number of the tests previously executed, either from the sequence before (if the <code>F</code> fails) or from the other half (if <code>F</code> does not fail). The cost is <code>O(n/4 * n/4)</code> = <code>O(n^2)</code></p>

<p>For the nth step, the cost is <code>O(n/2^n * n/2^n)</code> = <code>O(n^2/2^n)</code> = <code>O(0)</code></p>

<p>This n in the nth step is smaller than the other n, as each step divides by two the amount of tests to be included.</p>

<p>The amount of tests to be executed is <code>n + n/2 + n/4 + n/8 + ... + 1</code> which is roughly <code>2n</code>. Executing each test costs <code>O(1)</code> (by the assumption before), so the total cost is <code>O(2n)</code> = <code>O(n)</code></p>

<p>If we take it by the amount of steps we need to manually execute is 1 for the whole, 1 for the half, 1 for the quarter, &hellip;. = <code>O(log2 n)</code></p>

<h2>Procedure</h2>

<p>To keep the executed tests, I created a support branch where I deleted the tests that were selected to be excluded. Always executed &ldquo;all tests in the suite&rdquo; as this makes it faster to select in the IDE.</p>

<p>When the half taken was wrong, I reverted the last commit and selected the other half.</p>

<p>After finding the minimum sequence and solving the issue, this support branch was discarded</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the real scenario, with around 100 tests, searching manually in the naïve way would not have been possible. It would have cost 100 steps, as the minimum set that produces <code>F</code> had size 2 (so only one step was necessary).</p>

<p>Applying the dichotomous search, in 8-10 steps I had finished, with the guarantee that no matter how many tests produced the <code>F</code> I would have found it in a reasonable amount of time.</p>

<h2>Comments</h2>

<p>Finally, the root cause for the failing test <code>F</code> was the OrientDB InMemory implementation with Spring context, as the former does not allow two instances at the same time in the same JVM.</p>

<p>It was solved using <code>@DirtiesContext</code> in both cases of the minimum sequence that forms <code>F</code>, so no matter which order the executor decides, the context will always be clean for the next execution.</p>

<p>We found this thanks to a teammate&rsquo;s intuition.</p>
