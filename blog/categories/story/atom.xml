<h2>BEM 101</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/">this introduction</a> to a CSS style called Block, Element, Modifier methodology (BEM).</p>

<p>In it,</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>a block is a top-level abstraction of a new component</li>
<li>Child items, or elements, can be placed inside and these are denoted by two underscores following the name of the block [&hellip;].
modifiers can manipulate the block so that we can theme or style that particular component without inflicting changes on a completely unrelated module. This is done by appending two hyphens to the name of the block [&hellip;].</li>
</ul>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">this wikipedia page</a>, that describes what is a lambda expression or an anonymous function. How it can be used (e.g., currying, higher-order function, closures) and gives examples in many languages.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the small video and the discussion about programmers' talent at <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/programming-competitions-work-performance/">this page</a>. By Peteris Krumins.</p>

<p>The original video explains that being good at a programming contest correlates negatively with skill at a programming job, even if the company hires them.</p>

<p>The discussion explains the analogy with height and the NBA and concludes that this parameter should be preponderated with less importance than others.</p>

<h2>On Functors</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/on-functors/">this comparison</a> by Peteris Krumins of what the functors are in different languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>C++: function objects</li>
<li>Standard ML: generic implementation of interfaces. They allow to compose structures</li>
<li>Haskell: structure containing zero or more objects that can be converted to another structure containing the other objects. It&rsquo;s an homomorphism between two categories.</li>
<li>Prolog: built-in predicate for self-inspection and the atom at the start of the structure</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recursive Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/recursive-regular-expressions/">this article</a> on recursive regular expressions by Peteris Krumins.</p>

<p>In it, he lightly describes how a regular expression relates to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">Context-Free Grammar</a> and the language support for Perl to include recursive regular expressions. Based on the examples (e.g., <code>0^n1^n</code>), it really clicked to me that this could be expressed as a recursive function, with its base case and the recursive one. Also that it &ldquo;depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">wikipedia</a>)</p>

<h2>Thermodynamics and Garbage Collection</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/ThermoGC.html">this paper</a> by Henry G. Baker that explains the analogy of the garbage collection (&ldquo;a freezer&rdquo;) and thermodynamics, where the state mutator (th program, also an oven) modifies the garbage heap and introduces / extracts entropy into the system.</p>

<p>Comparison between entropy and lack of information, using the theories from Shannon, Maxwell-Boltzmann. There&rsquo;s a reference to the knapsack problem and to simulated annealing.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a gentle introduction to thermodynamics in layman terms: heat, temperature, microstates, macrostates, reversability, etc.</p>

<p>In this paper it is also reflected (in macro vs micro states) that the sum all parts is simpler than the single ones (i.e., Information Hiding)</p>
