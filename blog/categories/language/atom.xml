<h2>What Is Functional Programming?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://blog.jenkster.com/2015/12/what-is-functional-programming.html">this article</a> by Kris Jenkins where the author describes functional programming from an input &amp; output point of view.</p>

<p>Describes state of the system (maybe global or local) is input &amp; output of the function</p>

<p>Produced state changes are called side effects. the author calls the state inputs as &ldquo;side causes&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Side effects and causes are called complexity iceberg, as they are not visible under the water level (surface)</p>

<p>Also what a pure function is: one with no side causes or side effects; e.g., all its inputs are declared inputs (i.e., parameters) and all outputs are declared outputs (i.e., return value).</p>

<h2>Argument from the &ldquo;Real World&rdquo;</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://ronjeffries.com/xprog/articles/argument-from-the-real-world/">this article</a> by Ron Jeffries that dismantles the &ldquo;real world&rdquo;, as an excuse to use good practices: as in &ldquo;we could use that, but we live in the real world&rdquo;.</p>

<blockquote><p> [&hellip;] our job is to create the “real world” and not to imagine that our present situation is the only situation there is</p></blockquote>

<p>This is exactly our day to day task, to imagine a real world solution to present problems, maybe involving software in between.</p>

<h2>What Makes a Good Programmer Good?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://joshsymonds.com/blog/2013/11/03/what-makes-a-good-programmer-good/">this article</a> by Josh Symonds on the characteristics that differentiate a good programmer from the jobbing programmers, the list of skills to be a good programmer.</p>

<p>Explains what factors are related and not related to being a good one<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
<li>knowing that most programming problems have already been solved. You have to know where to look for the solution</li>
<li>not to be afraid to dig deep into problems: detect a problem and be eager to solve it; figure out what is wrong</li>
<li>go to the source: use the source as a fact, as analysis needs to be based on facts, not beliefs</li>
<li>just do it: to be driven to act</li>
<li>instinctively tackle problems head-on, grabbing the bull by the horns instead of waiting for it to be solved automagically; start solving the problem</li>
<li>excited about grabbing problems, about facing the cutting edge</li>
<li>taking the time to reflect and understand it before moving one to the next one</li>
<li>communicate well: succintly and eloquently expressing your thoughts. The author thinks this might be the most important aspect of all.</li>
<li>to be truly caring about what you do: not just a job, but a hobby, an interest, even a fascination; great programmers are always programming</li>
<li>thinking of programming of a way to shape the world, not just a money-making activity</li>
</ul>

<h2>Towards an understanding of technical debt</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://medium.com/@kellan/towards-an-understanding-of-technical-debt-ae0f97cc0553">this article</a> by Kellan Elliott-McCrea about some definitions of technical debt and why taking care of it matters for the future.</p>

<p>Talks about the way of inheriting projects by other teams and the paradox of &ldquo;investing more time to fix the problem than originally invested in coding it.&rdquo; Also about judgement.</p>

<p>I find it related to the &ldquo;theory building&rdquo; by Naur.</p>

<blockquote><p>There are at least 5 distinct things we mean we say “technical debt”.</p>

<ol>
<li>Maintenance work: buying breathing room</li>
<li>Features of the codebase that resist change</li>
<li>Operability choices that resist change</li>
<li>Code choices that suck the will to live</li>
<li>Dependencies that resist upgrading</li>

<h2>The future is parallel: What&rsquo;s a programmer to do?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/readings/MITApril2009Steele.pdf">these slides</a> by Guy Steele about the differences in linear vs parallel computing and about the old habits that we still have.</p>

<p>Some quotes:</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Good sequential code minimizes total number of operations.

<ul>
<li>Clever tricks to reuse previously computed results.</li>
<li>Good parallel code often performs redundant operations to reduce communication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good sequential algorithms minimize space usage.

<ul>
<li>Clever tricks to reuse storage.</li>
<li>Good parallel code often requires extra space to permit temporal decoupling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sequential idioms stress linear problem decomposition.

<ul>
<li>Process one thing at a time and accumulate results.</li>
<li>Good parallel code usually requires multiway problem decomposition and multiway aggregation of results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>A New Mindset</h3>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>DO loops are so 1950s! (Literally: Fortran is now 50 years old.)</li>
<li>So are linear linked lists! (Literally: Lisp is now 50 years old.)</li>
<li>Java-style iterators are so last millennium!</li>
<li>Even arrays are suspect!</li>
<li>As soon as you say <code>first, SUM = 0</code> you are hosed. Accumulators are BAD.</li>
<li>If you say, “process subproblems in order,” you lose.</li>
<li>The great tricks of the sequential past DON’T WORK.</li>
<li>The programming idioms that have become second nature to us as everyday tools DON’T WORK.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Parallel Future</h3>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>We need new strategies for problem decomposition.</li>
<li>Data structure design/object relationships</li>
<li>Algorithmic organization</li>
<li>Don’t split a problem into “the first” and “the rest.”</li>
<li>Do split a problem into roughly equal pieces. Then figure out how to combine general subsolutions.</li>
<li>Often this makes combining the results a bit harder.</li>
<li>We need programming languages and runtime implementations that support parallel strategies and hybrid sequential/parallel strategies.</li>
<li>We must learn to manage new space-time tradeoffs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>A program organized according to linear problem decomposition principles can be really hard to parallelize.</li>
<li>A program organized according to parallel problem decomposition principles is easily run either in parallel or sequentially, according to available resources.</li>
<li>The new strategy has costs and overheads. They will be reduced over time but will not disappear.</li>
<li>In a world of parallel computers of wildly varying sizes, this is our only hope for program portability in the future.</li>
<li>Better language design can encourage better parallel programming.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Principles Of Microservices</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://vimeo.com/131632250">this talk</a> by Sam Newman on microservices at the NDC 2015 at Oslo</p>

<p>Describes a microservice as a small, autonomous services that work together, modelled around a business domain</p>

<p>Microservices can mix technology, persistence stack, idioms, options</p>

<p>reference to the twelve factors (by heroku).</p>

<p>At a client:</p>

<blockquote><p>Design and delivery practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>standard http/rest</li>
<li>encapsulate legacy</li>
<li>eliminate integration databases</li>
<li>consolidate and cleanse data</li>
<li>published integration model</li>
<li>small independent devices</li>
<li>continous deployment</li>
<li>minimal customization of COTS/SAAS</li>
</ul>


<p>Architectural principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce inertia</li>
<li>eliminate accidential complexity</li>
<li>consistent interfaces and data flows</li>
<li>no silver bullets</li>
</ul>


<p>Strategic goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>enable scalable businesses</li>
<li>support entry into new markets</li>
<li>support innovation in existing markets</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Principles of microservices:</p>

<ul>
<li>modelled around a business domain</li>
<li>culture of automation</li>
<li>hide implementation details</li>
<li>decentralise all the things</li>
<li>deploy independently</li>
<li>consumer first</li>
<li>isolate failure</li>
<li>highly observable</li>
</ul>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>the business domain changes more slowly. find these boundaries (reference to IDDD)</p>

<p>bounded contexts is about concepts which are shared and others who are hidden</p>

<p>consumer driven contracts as a way to express to consumer expectations, written as tests. this is a high-trust pattern (requires it). reduces end to end testing, considerably. Using tools as [pact][github.com/realestate]</p>

<p>parallel change for endpoints (or APIs) for avoiding lock step release (expand contract pattern). high cost to change an API: apply upfront thought to it.</p>

<p>explains about a case writing a strangler application:</p>

<ul>
<li>circuit breakers</li>
<li>one thread pool per application</li>
<li>bulkhead downstream connections</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Your Company Should Have a Creed</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://ma.tt/2011/09/automattic-creed/">this essay</a> by Matt Mullenweg about the importance of having a company creed (a belief system, ethos), which ideally would be shared by the colleagues. These should be the values that help deciding, when in doubt, so everyone is aligned.</p>

<p>At Automattic, this is theirs (as of September 19th, 2011):</p>

<blockquote><p>I will never stop learning. I won’t just work on things that are assigned to me. I know there’s no such thing as a status quo. I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers. I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I’ll remember the days before I knew everything. I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation. I will communicate as much as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company. I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day. Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.</p></blockquote>

<p>She explains what works for them and what does not.</p>

<p>Also, she makes a difference on complex vs complicated work:</p>

<blockquote><p>complex work (where there is the potential for errors) over complicated work (where the solution is known, but is merely time consuming)</p></blockquote>

<p>Explains some characteristics of learning organizations:</p>

<blockquote><p>Teams in learning organizations perform ongoing experiments. While they settle on a core set of practices, they also try to build upon them. They keep innovating, improving, and reflecting. And how they work continues to evolve.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://hbr.org/2016/01/what-youre-hiding-from-when-you-constantly-check-your-phone">this article</a> by Charlotte Lieberman where she explains the technology-stress paradox and the fact of replacing one addiction with another, as some addictions are more socially than others.</p>

<p>Explains that the constant connection to social media allow us to avoid ourselves, and the connection to mindfulness.</p>

<p>On the paradox:</p>

<blockquote><p>technology-stress paradox: we share the desire for greater freedom from our devices, and yet that very freedom itself causes anxiety</p></blockquote>

<p>On the work-life balance:</p>

<blockquote><p> work-life balance [is]  [&hellip;] about noticing those moments in which you really don&rsquo;t want to deal with yourself</p></blockquote>

<h2>Anonymous function</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">this wikipedia page</a>, that describes what is a lambda expression or an anonymous function. How it can be used (e.g., currying, higher-order function, closures) and gives examples in many languages.</p>

<p>Cites its invention (Church, 1936, lambda-calculus) and its first implementation (Lisp, 1958)</p>

<p>Tags: alonzo-church, anonymous-function, lambda-expression, closure, lambda-calculus, lisp, currying, higher-order-function, wikipedia</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the small video and the discussion about programmers' talent at <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/programming-competitions-work-performance/">this page</a>. By Peteris Krumins.</p>

<p>The original video explains that being good at a programming contest correlates negatively with skill at a programming job, even if the company hires them.</p>

<p>The discussion explains the analogy with height and the NBA and concludes that this parameter should be preponderated with less importance than others.</p>

<h2>On Functors</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/on-functors/">this comparison</a> by Peteris Krumins of what the functors are in different languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>C++: function objects</li>
<li>Standard ML: generic implementation of interfaces. They allow to compose structures</li>
<li>Haskell: structure containing zero or more objects that can be converted to another structure containing the other objects. It&rsquo;s an homomorphism between two categories.</li>
<li>Prolog: built-in predicate for self-inspection and the atom at the start of the structure</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recursive Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/recursive-regular-expressions/">this article</a> on recursive regular expressions by Peteris Krumins.</p>

<p>In it, he lightly describes how a regular expression relates to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">Context-Free Grammar</a> and the language support for Perl to include recursive regular expressions. Based on the examples (e.g., <code>0^n1^n</code>), it really clicked to me that this could be expressed as a recursive function, with its base case and the recursive one. Also that it &ldquo;depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">wikipedia</a>)</p>

<h2>Thermodynamics and Garbage Collection</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/ThermoGC.html">this paper</a> by Henry G. Baker that explains the analogy of the garbage collection (&ldquo;a freezer&rdquo;) and thermodynamics, where the state mutator (th program, also an oven) modifies the garbage heap and introduces / extracts entropy into the system.</p>

<p>Comparison between entropy and lack of information, using the theories from Shannon, Maxwell-Boltzmann. There&rsquo;s a reference to the knapsack problem and to simulated annealing.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a gentle introduction to thermodynamics in layman terms: heat, temperature, microstates, macrostates, reversability, etc.</p>

<p>In this paper it is also reflected (in macro vs micro states) that the sum all parts is simpler than the single ones (i.e., Information Hiding)</p>

<h2>Type theory</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read this wiki page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_theory">type theory</a></p>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;type systems [&hellip;] language feature used to reduce bugs&rdquo;</li>
<li>two types: Church&rsquo;s typed λ-calculi and Martin-Löf&rsquo;s intuitionistic type theory.</li>
<li>notation:

<ul>
<li>typing judgement: <code>M : A</code>. Term <code>M</code> has type <code>A</code></li>
<li>example: <code>nat</code> may be a type</li>
<li><code>2 : nat</code>, like in Scala</li>
<li>function: &ldquo;arrow&rdquo;</li>
<li>apply function to argument: no parenthesis</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>conversion rule: rule for rewriting terms

<ul>
<li>reduction rule: conversion rule that only works in one direction</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>normal form: a form that cannot be further reduced</li>
<li>element: all closed elements that can be reduced to the same normal form</li>
<li>closed term: a term without parameters. Opposite is an open term</li>
<li>convertibility: property of terms, both open and closed. Said to be convertible if two terms can be reduced to the same term

<ul>
<li>warning: x + 1 and 1 + x are not convertible because they are in normal form and not the same</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Type system</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read this wiki page on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Type_system">type system</a></p>

<p>Some notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>&ldquo;The depth of type constraints and the manner of their evaluation affect the typing of the language&rdquo;</li>
<li>Type polymorphism</li>
<li>{compile time, runtime} x {manually annotated, inferred}</li>
<li>&ldquo;A program associates each value with at least one particular type, but it also can occur that one value is associated with many subtypes.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Classification of types:

<ul>
<li>data type – a type of a value</li>
<li>class – a type of an object</li>
<li>kind – a type of a type, or metatype</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the type inference might be undecidable (for more complex type inference)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Strong typing offers more safety, but cannot guarantee complete type safety.&rdquo; An example is the division by zero, altough some languages may declare a dependent type &ldquo;non-zero numbers&rdquo;</li>
</ul>
