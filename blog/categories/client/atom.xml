<ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Today I have facilitated a brown bag session about refactoring legacy code applications, as this is the case with one of the applications we maintain and add new features to.</p>

<p>The contents of the session:</p>

<ul>
<li>Briefly exposing the problem to the team, me taking the role of the Product Owner (PO)</li>
<li>Ask the dev team to add an easy feature</li>
<li>Do it without tests, as it was so simple that they thought they could do it (using mob programming)</li>
<li>Ask if they were satisfied by the patch / fix. Answer was yes.</li>
<li>Point out that there are regressions in the few lines of the patch</li>
<li>Repeat the session, starting with adding tests to guarantee the behavior is preserved  (using mob programming)</li>
<li>Explain the technique of the golden master</li>
<li>Some more programming, until they start to see the light at the end of the tunnel</li>
<li>Small retrospective, including:

<ul>
<li>asking them their feelings when dealing with legacy code. The contents of this is pretty similar to the concepts that appear in the retrospectives, when talking about the legacy project / submodule.</li>
<li>what could I improve as facilitator or for the structure of the session</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>The repo can be found <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/trivia-kata-spike">here</a>.</p>

<p>I prepared a small script:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">while test true; do
  git add --all;
  git commit --all -m "save process - uknown state";
  sleep 120;
done;
</code></pre>

<p>that saves the process and the progress, without disturbing the attendees. This allows you to follow the progress without any distraction. This idea was taken from a similar one from  <a href="http://twitter.com/@xav1uzz">Xavi Gost</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup></p>

<p>This same idea was also cited by someone else, if I recall correctly by Sandro Mancuso, saying that it would be a good idea to have a background git repository while working. IntelliJ IDEA already does something similar (and saves the events, e.g., when the tests are run, either red or green)</p>

<p>Cannot find the source, it was about having a script to commit automatically each time you run the tests; if it was red while refactoring, it would do git checkout (to revert); Was related to the noFlopSquad<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<li>AUFS (Another Union FS)</li>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/19/logging-is-a-feature/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-19T23:43:10+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/19/logging-is-a-feature</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At a client, we&rsquo;re facing this challenge: we cannot access production logs, as we don&rsquo;t have access to production environments. The solution we&rsquo;ve chose is to implement the logging component as a layer on top of <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>.</p>

<p>This formatter layer &ndash;per component&ndash; accesses a generic layer &ndash;for the whole company&ndash; that accesses splunk. In this manner, it is very easy to reuse the splunk connection and configuration and inject mocks. Also helps with the local environment: you always log to console (even if in production you don&rsquo;t have access to it) and can disable this in local, not needing a local splunk installation.</p>

<p>Strategies for dealing with this:</p>

<ul>
<li>functional logger: no shared state

<ul>
<li>can only log information available in this scope: parameters, attributes, static information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>stateful logger: information is added to the threadContext and logged whenever necessary

<ul>
<li>can log information in this scope plus any of the previous invokings.</li>
<li>the problem is precisely sharing state: you have to control all the possible parents to know where this data comes from. A piece of information may come from any source.</li>
<li>Lose the reference of who is invoking you, as there is no customization for this. (only using implementation)</li>
<li>Speak two different languages: one for logging and one for business logic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mixed: mix and match the best of both worlds.

<ul>
<li>The problem with the shared state can be solved if no data is overwritten and any information is stored in a map where the key is the fully qualified (FQ) method name (or FQ class name + FQ method name)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>The GOOS book explains this very well on the 20th chapter, first half &ldquo;logging is a feature&rdquo;. If we log as described in chapters 19 and 20, some of the problems are reduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>multiple levels of abstraction</li>
<li>indirect control over logging. decide in a single place whether to log exceptions of each kind or not</li>
<li>remove &ldquo;implementation details&rdquo; such as &ldquo;log.isDebugEnabled&rdquo;</li>
<li>remove performance issues: no need to build strings for logging every time, only need to pass objects. inside the logging layer, if the logger is enabled for that level, then spend the time building strings and print them</li>
</ul>


<p>We should remember that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Whenever logging becomes useful data (for the stakeholders) it no longer is a debug information and needs to be tested (automatically). In my opinion, it is not enough to test it daily when debugging, as these stakeholders rely on the data. Also, humans are not good detecting small differences, while machines excel at it.</li>
<li>Why treat the logging feature different from any other? It is an investment, like any other, and as such should work properly</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/17/the-guardian-of-the-source/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-17T22:01:48+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/17/the-guardian-of-the-source</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Overheard today at the office, while they were discussing the approval of a pull request:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Pull request reviewer] - I&rsquo;m sorry, can&rsquo;t approve this: I don&rsquo;t really agree with this design. Isn&rsquo;t there an alternative for this?</p>

<p>[Pull request author] - [redacted], of course you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re the guardian of the source</p>

<p>[PR reviewer] - Well, sometimes I&rsquo;m a bit picky about introducing bad code into our codebase.</p></blockquote>

<p>This has made me think about Gandalf blocking the path of Balrog Demon, shouting &ldquo;<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-shall-not-pass">you shall not pass</a>&rdquo; while on top of the bridge.</p>

<p>This is part of the objectives of doing a pull request before merging code: stop the bad code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> before it is merged to the codebase.</p>

<p>Later, as you start having <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken windows</a> in your codebase, it is easier that you start introducing more. Exactly about this is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken windows theory</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you try to block that bad code before it is merged, it is cheaper to remove it: nothing depends on it, you introduce no repetition, etc<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This also connects with the idea present in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Software-Craftsman-Professionalism-Pragmatism/dp/0134052501">Software Craftsmanship, now called The Software Craftsman</a>, about preserving value for investors and treat software as an investment (with positive ROI) rather than a sunk cost.</p>

<p>It is being picky and, to the most of our possibilities, do not letting any defects nor bad code into the codebase. A hedge fund manager would not let any toxic or dubious asset into the managed funds. This would be counterproductive in the long run (maybe even in the short one) and would be not doing their job correctly. Why is it that some developers suggest or accept these toxic assets?</p>

<p>So, at least for me, would be an honor to be called the &ldquo;Guardian of the Source&rdquo; by someone I respect, as long as this is a serious proposition (i.e., not a joke of some kind).</p>
