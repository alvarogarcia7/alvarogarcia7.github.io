<li>every classloader has a parent</li>
<li>every class has a classloader associated with it</li>
<li>every object has a class associated with it</li>
<li>classloading delegation: the parent is consulted before loading a class. if it has it, it will load it. If not, I will delegate it</li>

<h2>Turing completeness</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">this wikipedia article</a> (both main and discussion) about this subject.</p>

<p>It has sounded strange to me the reference to S-expressions:</p>

<blockquote><p>Data languages
The notion of Turing-completeness does not apply to languages such as XML, HTML, JSON, YAML and S-expressions because they are typically used to represent structured data, not describe computation [&hellip;]</p></blockquote>

<p>If data (S-expression) is represented as the same format as code (e.g., Lisp&rsquo;s S-expression) and the latter is used to represent a computation, shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;data languages that also are used as computation languages&rdquo; excluded from that list?</p>

<p>As a side note, Lisp is Turing Complete (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness#Examples">Turing Complete#Examples</a>)</p>
