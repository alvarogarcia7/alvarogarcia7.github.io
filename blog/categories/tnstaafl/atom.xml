<h2>BEM 101</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://css-tricks.com/bem-101/">this introduction</a> to a CSS style called Block, Element, Modifier methodology (BEM).</p>

<p>In it,</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>a block is a top-level abstraction of a new component</li>
<li>Child items, or elements, can be placed inside and these are denoted by two underscores following the name of the block [&hellip;].
modifiers can manipulate the block so that we can theme or style that particular component without inflicting changes on a completely unrelated module. This is done by appending two hyphens to the name of the block [&hellip;].</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
