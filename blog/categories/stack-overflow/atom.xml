<h2>An interview with Charles Wetherell</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/08/25/interview-with-charles-wetherell/">this interview</a> by Alexander Demin about the interviewee&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Etudes for Programmers&rdquo;. In it, they talk about the origin of the études, the author&rsquo;s research interests and activities. Also about the book (written in 1978) and how computer science has changed since then.</p>

<p>When asked about three things a programmer should know:</p>

<blockquote><p>Some ability to do formal mathematics. The level necessary to understand Hopcroft and Ullman combined with a little graph theory is enough. Discrete mathematics is essential; calculus is only necessary for folks working in special application areas.</p>

<p>Some ability to write clearly in their native language. Dijkstra said that if a person couldn’t write their own language, they couldn’t write a correct program. (Well, that’s what I hope Dijkstra said!). Writing programs is essentially the same as writing a non-fiction essay. If you can’t make the step-by-step connections clearly in your own language, why would we think you could in C, for example?</p>

<p>Remember that a program is primarily for communication with humans, not computers. When you write a program, the computer will do whatever you say. You must convince the humans who read the program that what you have asked the computer to do is the correct thing to do. Remember, the computer doesn’t care about correctness.</p>

<p> The answer to the last question means that programs should always have the form of paragraphs of comments that describe the intention of the program followed by paragraphs of code that implement that intention. All of the formatting should be designed to make readers as able as possible to read the code easily; the compiler doesn’t care. In particular, follow conventions of mathematics and your native language, not those you found in some random language manual. Write the comments first and then write the code, not the other way around. If you don’t know what you want to achieve and why, any code you write is, by definition, incorrect.</p></blockquote>

Concludes that both players need each other, in a symbiotic fashion, to keep their jobs at the company.</p>

<p>He suggests that Scrum cannot work without the XP practices and that we need to refactor aggressively after having finished our initial design, to keep the costs down. In fact, agreeing with both parts in this discussion.</p>

<p>References one of his own videos, at Oredev'13, &ldquo;Fundamental Theorem of Agile Software Development&rdquo;, where he describes the relationship between accidental / essential complexity in the cost of a feature, attributing most of it to accidental (&lsquo;we&rsquo;re not good at our jobs&rsquo;) and describing the need for more design / refactor after the initial design.</p>

<h2>Habits For Effective Refactoring</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THw8t7ePlsc">this video</a> by Jason Gorman about techniques for effective and sustainable refactoring. Among them:</p>

<ul>
<li>check the tests, the coverage to make sure that the refactored code has a good safety net</li>
<li>set a refactoring goal: decide what you want to refactor at this time and when you&rsquo;ll be done</li>
<li>know your code smells</li>
<li>only refactor on green</li>
<li>use automated refactoring steps whenever possible: for the benefits of transactionability and undo are huge and the risk of messing it up decreases</li>
<li>commit after achieving the refactoring goal: allows to create a checkpoint to revert to</li>
<li>bottle the code smells for faster/better learning (in the commit message, he uses a hashtag for searching)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Show How, Don&rsquo;t Tell What - A Management Style</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://2ndscale.com/rtomayko/2012/management-style">this article</a> by Ryan Tomayko about the management style they apply at github:</p>

<blockquote><p>instead of telling them what to do, show people how to plan, build, and ship product together.</p>

<p>I’ve never actually told anyone what to do here. In fact, I vehemently refuse to tell people what to do. Here are just a couple reasons why:</p>

<p>I don’t scale. If I tell someone what to do and they do it, then what? Do I have to tell them another thing to do? What happens when I have to decide what to do for 20 people?</p>

<p>Telling people what to do is lazy. Instead, try to convince them with argument. This is how humans interact when there’s no artificial authority structure and it works great. If you can’t convince people through argument then maybe you shouldn’t be doing it.</p></blockquote>

<p>about managers:</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s often cited that GitHub doesn’t have managers. In my opinion, a better way to describe the phenomenon would be to say that everyone at GitHub is a manager</p></blockquote>

<h2>This is why you never end up hiring good developers</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://qz.com/258066/this-is-why-you-dont-hire-good-developers/">this article</a> that explains what to look for in a strong, stronger, strongest (software) developer</p>

<p>The main idea is to find a good person that fits the job, without inflicting pain in the team morale and can learn to perform the specific tasks in the future, as (paraprasing) the pool of people that know what you need is much smaller than the people who can learn it.</p>

<p>The article specifies what to look and not look for in a candidate.</p>

<p>Some quotes:</p>

<blockquote><p>grasp of complex topics and the ability to clearly communicate about them, which are the two jobs of the working engineer.</p>

<p>track record of learning new skills and applying them successfully</p>

<p>TL;DR:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Many interview techniques test skills that are at best irrelevant to real working life;</p></li>
<li><p>you want somebody who knows enough to do the job right now;</p></li>
<li><p>or somebody smart and motivated enough that they can learn the job quickly;</p></li>
<li><p>you want somebody who keeps getting better at what they do;</p></li>
<li><p>your interview should be a collaborative conversations, not a combative interrogation;</p></li>
<li><p>you also want somebody who you will enjoy working with;</p></li>
<li><p>it’s important to separate “enjoy working with” from “enjoy hanging out with;”</p></li>
<li><p>don’t hire assholes, no matter how good they are;</p></li>
<li><p>if your team isn’t diverse, your team is worse than it needed to be;</p></li>
<li><p>accept that hiring takes a really long time and is really, really hard.</p></li>

Or that could be attributed to a programming mistake. The later, says the author, is so common that there could be already intentional or unintentional errors hiding cheating.</p>

<p>The author cites the Internet of Things of new opportunities for companies to use / produce cheating software and about a possible solution: transparency and oversight of the software that more and more reigns our lives.</p>

<h2>Anonymous function</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">this wikipedia page</a>, that describes what is a lambda expression or an anonymous function. How it can be used (e.g., currying, higher-order function, closures) and gives examples in many languages.</p>

<p>Cites its invention (Church, 1936, lambda-calculus) and its first implementation (Lisp, 1958)</p>

<p>Tags: alonzo-church, anonymous-function, lambda-expression, closure, lambda-calculus, lisp, currying, higher-order-function, wikipedia</p>

<h2>Closure</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)">this wikipedia page</a>, that explains the concept of closures and the usual confusion between closure and lambda. Also some applications.</p>

<p>Discusses closures as a way of deferring execution and implementing object-oriented (OO) systems</p>

<h2>Being good at programming competitions correlates negatively with being good on the job</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the small video and the discussion about programmers' talent at <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/programming-competitions-work-performance/">this page</a>. By Peteris Krumins.</p>

<p>The original video explains that being good at a programming contest correlates negatively with skill at a programming job, even if the company hires them.</p>

<p>The discussion explains the analogy with height and the NBA and concludes that this parameter should be preponderated with less importance than others.</p>

<h2>On Functors</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/on-functors/">this comparison</a> by Peteris Krumins of what the functors are in different languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>C++: function objects</li>
<li>Standard ML: generic implementation of interfaces. They allow to compose structures</li>
<li>Haskell: structure containing zero or more objects that can be converted to another structure containing the other objects. It&rsquo;s an homomorphism between two categories.</li>
<li>Prolog: built-in predicate for self-inspection and the atom at the start of the structure</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recursive Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/recursive-regular-expressions/">this article</a> on recursive regular expressions by Peteris Krumins.</p>

<p>In it, he lightly describes how a regular expression relates to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">Context-Free Grammar</a> and the language support for Perl to include recursive regular expressions. Based on the examples (e.g., <code>0^n1^n</code>), it really clicked to me that this could be expressed as a recursive function, with its base case and the recursive one. Also that it &ldquo;depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">wikipedia</a>)</p>

<h2>Thermodynamics and Garbage Collection</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/ThermoGC.html">this paper</a> by Henry G. Baker that explains the analogy of the garbage collection (&ldquo;a freezer&rdquo;) and thermodynamics, where the state mutator (th program, also an oven) modifies the garbage heap and introduces / extracts entropy into the system.</p>

<p>Comparison between entropy and lack of information, using the theories from Shannon, Maxwell-Boltzmann. There&rsquo;s a reference to the knapsack problem and to simulated annealing.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a gentle introduction to thermodynamics in layman terms: heat, temperature, microstates, macrostates, reversability, etc.</p>

<p>In this paper it is also reflected (in macro vs micro states) that the sum all parts is simpler than the single ones (i.e., Information Hiding)</p>

<h2>Alternatives to boolean parameters</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/dariusz-pasciak/2015/05/28/alternatives-to-boolean-parameters.html">this article</a> explaining alternatives to sending a boolean parameter to decide on the contents of the function. Written by Dariusz Pasciak</p>

<p>As I heard some time ago, if a function receives a boolean to decide on what to do, it will for sure have more than one responsibility: one for the false value and one for the true value.</p>
