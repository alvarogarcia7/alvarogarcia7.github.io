<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/315-call-me-maybe-rabbitmq">this article</a> by Kyle Kingsbury on using RabbitMQ as a lock service. It investigates and gives a counterexample of using it for this purpose.</p>

<p>Uses Knossos to do the testing and surfaces a problem with it. Explains specific problems on locking: at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery</p>

<p>Note: References Jepsen (I guess an inside joke to the song &ldquo;Call me maybe&rdquo; by Carly Rae Jepsen) for at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery.</p>

<h2>Ragel State Machine Compiler</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.colm.net/open-source/ragel/">this article</a> explaining what the Ragel project is about: a code generator from regex to code in languages such as C#, Java, etc. It is limited to finite state machines (FSM), with determinism. It can also handle some indeterminism. Written by Adrian D. Thurston</p>

<h2>Recovering From the Integrated Tests Scam</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://us2.campaign-archive1.com/?u=80ca60ec48ef77dfaa1f38943&amp;id=42e61e203e&amp;e=4a925444f9">this article</a> from J. B. Rainsberger on the integrated test scam and how to solve it: refactoring.</p>

<p>Tags: jbrains, tdd, integrated-test, integration-test, j-rainsberger</p>

<h2>Broken windows theory</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">this wikipedia article</a> that talks about the broken windows theory, that states that controlling and monitoring public spaces leads to lowering the serious crimes.</p>

<p>Cites three causes for this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Social norms and conformity</li>
<li>Lack of routing monitoring</li>
<li>Social signaling and signal crime</li>
</ul>


<p>Also discusses examples in the US and in the Netherlands, as well as criticisms.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read it to better understand how to apply this theory to software development, on a day-to-day basis.</p>

<p>Tags: wikipedia, theory, broken-window</p>

<h2>Scsh</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scsh">the wikipedia page</a> for Scsh, the Scheme shell.</p>

<h2>Why is Scala&rsquo;s type inference not as powerful as Haskell&rsquo;s?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read the reasoning why Haskell supports other type inferences that are not present in Scala, in <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/7234095/why-is-scalas-type-inference-not-as-powerful-as-haskells">this StackOverflow question</a></p>

<h2>The Future of the LispM</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://arrdem.com/2014/11/28/the_future_of_the_lispm/">this article</a> explaining the past and current situation in the Lisp world: from Lisp, to LispM, to the MIT and Symbolics Inc., to Clojure and Scheme.</p>

<p>Also talks about integration with the operating system and its execution in the microprocessor. Written by Reid McKenzie</p>

<p>Tags: reid-mckenzie, lisp, lispm, clojure, scheme, symbolics</p>

<h2>The Lisp Curse</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html">this essay</a> by Rudolf Winestock, where he explains the low barrier (or low cost) for people in powerful languages (such as Lisp) to not accept the status quo in their project and fork / start their own.</p>

<p>It also compares languages and the people attracted to them. Cites Mark Tarver&rsquo;s essays several times, including the Brilliant Bipolar Mind (BBM) in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150308085419/http://www.lambdassociates.org/blog/bipolar.htm">this other</a> essay (from WebArchive). Compares the BBM and the normal worker in usefulness to companies.</p>

<p>Cites the Pareto principle (80-20 rule): a single hacker will port 80% the library from another language, leaving it buggy, undocumented and only understandable by the original author (assuming this is only 20% of the work). The rest (e.g., documentation, bugfixing, maintenance) are dropped and never taken care of.</p>

<p>Cites that this could be somewhat based on the facility of creating new features for the language. A small effort implies small implementation time, leaving no margin for thinking it through and seeing other corner cases. Also, a single person working on the project means no code review. The style might be coherent (always the same one), but might not be idiomatic, understandable by others, maintainable, etc.</p>

<p>Closes the essay with this quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>The expressive power of Lisp has drawbacks. There is no such thing as a free lunch.</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Bipolar Lisp Programmer</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150308085419/http://www.lambdassociates.org/blog/bipolar.htm">this essay</a> by Mark Tarver on the Bipolar Lisp programmmer or the koan of Lisp.</p>

<p>It explains the history of the Brilliant Bipolar Mind (BBM) when they attend high school and college. The freedom they&rsquo;re given, exactly the same as in Lisp, as you don&rsquo;t need to mix and socialize with others to create a good-enough solution.</p>

<p>In this fashion, he says, most of the projects are 80% finished, not documented, not maintained. The same problems that worry enterprises.</p>

<p>Cites the article &ldquo;Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big&rdquo;</p>

<p>Tags: essay, mark-tarver, bipolar-lisp-programmer, lisp-programmer, programmer, brillian-bipolar-mind, blp, bbm, koan</p>

<h2>On Functors</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/on-functors/">this comparison</a> by Peteris Krumins of what the functors are in different languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>C++: function objects</li>
<li>Standard ML: generic implementation of interfaces. They allow to compose structures</li>
<li>Haskell: structure containing zero or more objects that can be converted to another structure containing the other objects. It&rsquo;s an homomorphism between two categories.</li>
<li>Prolog: built-in predicate for self-inspection and the atom at the start of the structure</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recursive Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/recursive-regular-expressions/">this article</a> on recursive regular expressions by Peteris Krumins.</p>

<p>In it, he lightly describes how a regular expression relates to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">Context-Free Grammar</a> and the language support for Perl to include recursive regular expressions. Based on the examples (e.g., <code>0^n1^n</code>), it really clicked to me that this could be expressed as a recursive function, with its base case and the recursive one. Also that it &ldquo;depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">wikipedia</a>)</p>

<h2>Thermodynamics and Garbage Collection</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/ThermoGC.html">this paper</a> by Henry G. Baker that explains the analogy of the garbage collection (&ldquo;a freezer&rdquo;) and thermodynamics, where the state mutator (th program, also an oven) modifies the garbage heap and introduces / extracts entropy into the system.</p>

<p>Comparison between entropy and lack of information, using the theories from Shannon, Maxwell-Boltzmann. There&rsquo;s a reference to the knapsack problem and to simulated annealing.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a gentle introduction to thermodynamics in layman terms: heat, temperature, microstates, macrostates, reversability, etc.</p>

<p>In this paper it is also reflected (in macro vs micro states) that the sum all parts is simpler than the single ones (i.e., Information Hiding)</p>

<h2>Alternatives to boolean parameters</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/dariusz-pasciak/2015/05/28/alternatives-to-boolean-parameters.html">this article</a> explaining alternatives to sending a boolean parameter to decide on the contents of the function. Written by Dariusz Pasciak</p>
