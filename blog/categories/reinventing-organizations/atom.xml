    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A quote from <a href="http://www.reinventingorganizations.com">Reinventing Organizations</a>,
about roles, job descriptions and job titles in Chapter 2.2:
Self-management (structures), page 90:</p>

<blockquote><p> [In] Teal Organizations [&hellip;] people are not made to fit pre-defined jobs;
 their job emerge from a multitude of roles and responsibilities they pick
 up based on their interests, talents, and the needs of the organization.
- Frederic Laloux, Reinventing Organizations</p></blockquote>

<p>In my opinion, this is the role of the software consultant when working with a client:
even if the customer has asked for help in some parts of their activity, a senior-enough
consultant can discover other areas where they can add value, even if that new
work doesn&rsquo;t have much in common with the initial request (this change should
be approved by the people that will be affected).</p>

<p>This is also a thought that <a href="https://twitter.com/@mashooq">Mash</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/@sandromancuso">Sandro</a> were discussing lately.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A quote from <a href="http://www.reinventingorganizations.com">Reinventing Organizations</a>,
about a few unwritten principles for coaching, in Chapter 2.2:
Self-management (structures), page 70:</p>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>It’s okay for teams to struggle. From struggle comes learning. And
teams that have gone through difficult moments build resilience
and a deep sense of community. The coach’s role therefore is not
to prevent foreseeable problems, but to support teams in solving
them (and later help them reflect on how they’ve grown in the
process).</li>
<li>The coach’s role is to let teams make their own choices, even if she
believes she knows a better solution.</li>
<li>The coach supports the team mostly by asking insightful questions
and mirroring what she sees. She helps teams frame issues and
solutions in light of [the company’s] purpose and its holistic approach
to care.</li>
<li>The starting point is always to look for enthusiasm, strengths, and
existing capabilities within the team. The coach projects trust that
the team has all it takes to solve the problems it faces.</li>
<li>Frederic Laloux, Reinventing Organizations</li>
</ul>
