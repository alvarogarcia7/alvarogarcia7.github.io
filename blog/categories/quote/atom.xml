    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.msr-waypoint.net/en-us/groups/ese/nagappan_tdd.pdf">this paper</a> by Nagappan, Maximilien, Bhat and Williams on the cost, advantages, pitfalls of doing TDD in industrial teams (private companies who create software).</p>

<h2>My notes</h2>

<p>Abstract:</p>

<blockquote><p>little empirical evidence supports or refutes the utility of this practice in an industrial context</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>they seem to be talking about inside-out tdd as in chapter 2 (page 291), they talk about small units and then integrating them in a bigger context</li>
</ul>


<h3>Benefits</h3>

<p>taken from chapter 2 (page 292)</p>

<ul>
<li>Better design</li>
<li>Efficiency</li>
<li>Test assets</li>
<li>Reducing defect injection</li>
</ul>


<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<blockquote><p>TDD seems to be applicable in various domains</p>

<p>[TDD] can significantly reduce the defect density of developed software without significant productivity reduction [&hellip;]</p>

<p>[&hellip;] an important aspect of TDD is the creation of tests assets.</p></blockquote>

<p>Recommendations (this is all quotes):</p>

<ul>
<li>Start TDD from the beginning of projects</li>
<li>For a team new to TDD, introduce automated build test integration towards the second third of the development phase</li>
<li>[&hellip;] add new tests every time a problem is found</li>
<li>Get the test team involved and knowledgeable about the TDD approach</li>
<li>Constantly running the unit tests [&hellip;]</li>
<li>Encourage fast unit test execution and efficient unit testing design</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the prologue of the book, while thanking everyone that has made the book possible:</p>

<blockquote><p>[&hellip;], none of the people mentioned here would be responsible for any inaccuracy that might exist in the book, as this responsibility is exclusively mine</p>

<p>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (translated)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, prologue of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-The-Psychology-Optimal-Experience/dp/0061339202">Flow</a>&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p></p>

<p>This connects with what <a href="http://twitter.com/@tastapod">Dan North</a> said in the Craft Conf about this idea of the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only one in the company producing good quality work, the rest are not doing the same&rdquo;. Of course, he was quoting greedy, selfish people who think this instead of attributing the success to the whole team.</p>

<p>Regarding the whole team, if I recall correctly, it was <a href="http://twitter.com/@svenpet">Sven Peters</a> who explained that &ldquo;[&hellip;] either the team wins or looses. There are no individual wins [&hellip;]&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>In this sense, Csikszentmihalyi assumes all responsibility when quoting and reflecting on other&rsquo;s works. It was his idea to develop on top of others, so any imperfection is his.</p>

<p>This is similar as when approving a pull request: you make sure that the code works and you stand by it. It is no longer the original owner&rsquo;s cause, but yours too, as you have signed this request. On the pull request, though, the code ownership is already distributed among the whole team, but approvals ensures the presence of the <a href="/blog/categories/guardian-of-the-source">guardian of the source</a></p>

    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/25/demand-for-tdd-and-refactor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I went to the Jason Gorman&rsquo;s TDD workshop (experience report <a href="../../../../2015/04/12/jason-gorman-tdd-intensive-workshop">here</a>), he said something interesting regarding refactor and TDD:</p>

<blockquote><p>In job offers / advertisements, TDD is much more in demand than refactor. But the latter is included in the former as an integral part.</p>

<p>Jason Gorman</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with the second thought: you cannot properly do TDD without refactoring, as it is an integral part; also the third phase.</p>

<p>For me, sometimes refactoring is the difference between code and &ldquo;Clean Code&rdquo; (as defined in the book by the same title). If I cannot find the (algorithmic) pattern for the software I&rsquo;m writing, I try to introduce scaffolds to keep investigating until I can find a viable, general solution (if the problem requires it.)</p>

<p>Even after doing the refactor <code>replace algorithm</code>, the code might not have the responsibilities in the right place, the methods might be long, value objects not extracted yet, etc. This is where further refactor is needed to introduce all those qualities in the piece of software.</p>

<p>I believe that we programmers have done a bad job of communicating with the rest of the organization what refactoring is about. It has nothing to do with beauty, style or design (in the visual sense) but is related to maintainability, coupling, defects and quality. Money, in the long run, as its objective is to make it cheaper to change in the future, a better investment and ROI. This is the common language that the rest of the company understands.</p>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/21/what-legacy-code-is-about/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-21T22:09:54+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/21/what-legacy-code-is-about</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In his book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Working-Effectively-Legacy-Michael-Feathers/dp/0131177052/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1429647115&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=legacy+code+feathers">Working effectively with legacy code</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/mfeathers">Michael Feathers</a> describes:</p>

<blockquote><p>[&hellip;] legacy code as code without tests. It is a good working definition, and it points to a solution [&hellip;]</p>

<p>M Feathers, in the preface of Working effectively with legacy code</p></blockquote>

<p>I really like this definition. It is objective and measurable. But this is also a downside. Let&rsquo;s take any concurrent code, for example: you can achieve 100% coverage on a single thread and the program could have defects when executed in parallel. But this might be an outlier, as concurrency is difficult to test. Let&rsquo;s take another example.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s a imagine a non-concurrent (i.e., single thread) code composed by a single class (no collaborators; just one responsibility; it is &ldquo;Clean Code&rdquo;, as defined per R.C. Martin&rsquo;s book) that has some happy paths as well as some error-handling cases. As usual. The original code writer has decided to test only the happy paths. They deployed it to production, as the product was ready. You inherit this code.</p>

<p>After the system is deployed to production, you start receiving defect reports on the happy paths (the tested part). The first one, you cross it off as an one-time thing. Then the second and third come. You take a deeper look and start seeing some inconsistencies in the tests, some tests that actually do not test anything interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li>some test the test framework</li>
<li>some the language</li>
<li>some test a happy path that works by pure luck</li>
<li>some functionalities are tested (not all happy paths)</li>
<li>there&rsquo;s actually a defect converted into a specification (test) (??)</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, I ask myself this question: when did I start considering this code as legacy? When I saw the bug reports in production (several in a row) or when I saw the poor suite of tests?</p>

<p>I do think this codebase is legacy, no matter when I realized about it. But my first instinct would be to consider it legacy from the moment I received the bug reports, as I lost the trust in that code.</p>

<p>Because for me, <strong>legacy code is about trust, not tests</strong>. You can have tests but no trust; you can have trust but no tests (the latter is more difficult in non-trivial codebases.)</p>

<p>This is why I would like to update the definition:</p>

<blockquote><p>Legacy code is code without tests that provide trust to all your stakeholders</p></blockquote>

<p>The last part is very important, because the definition is no longer objective but depends from person to person. If the codebase doesn&rsquo;t have tests, it is definitely legacy. But even if it has them, would you consider the given example a legacy or non-legacy code?</p>

<p>These stakeholders include everyone affected or affecting the product: owners, developer team (in the scrum, wide sense), users, clients, &hellip;</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I&rsquo;ve written plenty of legacy code. Code which I thought was good but really wasn&rsquo;t. Even with tests, even with TDD, even with Clean Code. This has made me change my mind about what legacy code is all about.</p>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/02/24/the-purple-wire/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-24T20:57:43+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/02/24/the-purple-wire</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>A quote from the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Mythical-Man-Month-Engineering-Anniversary/dp/0201835959">Mythical Man-Month</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>Chapter 13: The Whole and the Parts</p>

<p>[&hellip;] In System/360 engineering models, one saw occasional strands of purple wire among the routine yellow wires. When a bug was found, two things were done. A quick fix was devised and installed on the system, so testing could proceed. This change was put on in purple wire, so it stuck out like a sore thumb. It was entered in the log. Meanwhile, an official change document was prepared and started into the design automation mill. Eventually this resulted in updated drawings and wire lists, and a new back panel in which the change was implemented in printed circuitry or yellow wire. Now the physical model and the paper were together again, and the purple wire was gone.</p>

<p>Programming needs a purple-wire technique, and it badly needs tight control and deep respect for the paper that ultimately is the product. The vital ingredients of such technique are the logging of all changes in a journal and the distinction, carried conspicuously in source code, between quick patches and thought-through, tested, documented fixes.</p>

<p>[&hellip;]</p>

<p><quote> Brooks, F. - The Mythical Man-Month</quote></p></blockquote>

<p>This purple-wire the author talks about is extremely important even in the current age as the whole team should not be blocked by a single defect.</p>

<p>What I usually do is a commit containing a quick fix (purple-wire, scaffold, hackish if, etc) on a bugfix branch, push the changes so jenkins can verify that this purple-wire didn&rsquo;t break any other case. Then integrate this bugfix into master if required<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>. If this affects <code>develop</code> branch of other developers, also merge into develop and or feature branches.</p>

<p>On the other hand, in my opinion, fixing the defect should include an unit test so the defect does not reproduce again. If this is not reproducible through an unit one, escalate test levels (unit, integration, end to end, etc) until a suitable one is found.</p>

<p>Once that applying the purple-wire is done, I <code>checkout</code> the last version where the defect is to be found (usually right before the bugfix branch) and create this test necessary to reproduce behavior. Only after this defect is found I fix it. Otherwise, I think the root cause might be in a different place and, therefore, fix a non-existing defect, effectively introducing a regression.</p>

<p>This test also serves to reproduce that the corrected behavior is not introduced anymore into the system.</p>

<p>As an ending phase for the defect, replace the purple wire with the new code and, after passing all tests, merge to master, develop and feature branches.</p>
<div class="footnotes">
<hr/>
<ol>
<li id="fn:1">
<p>If the found defect is not business critical, I try not to merge to master the purple wire, just leave master pointing to the defect and the bugfix branch with the solution. This bugfix branch will be deleted when a more stable fix is found.<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
