    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In Working effectively with legacy code, Michael Feathers talks a type of tests to define or characterize the current behavior of the legacy system:</p>

<blockquote><p>In nearly every legacy system, what the system does is more important than what it is supposed to do.</p>

<p>A <em>characterization test</em> is a test that characterizes the actual behavior of a piece of code. [&hellip;] The test document the actual current behavior of the system. Here is a little algorithm for writing algorithm for writing characterization tests:</p>

<ul>
<li>Use a piece of code in a test harness</li>
<li>Write an assertion that you know will fail</li>
<li>Let the failure tell you what the behavior is.</li>
<li>Change the test so that it expects the behavior that the code produces</li>
<li>Repeat</li>
</ul>


<p>M Feathers, in the chapter 13<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, section &ldquo;Characterization tests&rdquo; of Working effectively with legacy code. Actual page, 186.</p></blockquote>

<p>Later on, he goes to describe them in a bigger environment:</p>

<blockquote><p>Characterization tests record the actual behavior of a piece of code. If we find something unexpected when we write them, it pays to get some clarification. It could be a bu. That doesn&rsquo;t mean that we don&rsquo;t include the test in our test suite; instead, we should mark it as suspicious an find out what th effect would be of fixing it.</p>

<p>M Feathers, in the chapter 13<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, section &ldquo;Characterization tests&rdquo; of Working effectively with legacy code. Actual page, 188.</p></blockquote>

<li>a block is a top-level abstraction of a new component</li>
<li>Child items, or elements, can be placed inside and these are denoted by two underscores following the name of the block [&hellip;].
modifiers can manipulate the block so that we can theme or style that particular component without inflicting changes on a completely unrelated module. This is done by appending two hyphens to the name of the block [&hellip;].</li>

<h2>What Is Functional Programming?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://blog.jenkster.com/2015/12/what-is-functional-programming.html">this article</a> by Kris Jenkins where the author describes functional programming from an input &amp; output point of view.</p>

<p>Describes state of the system (maybe global or local) is input &amp; output of the function</p>

<p>Produced state changes are called side effects. the author calls the state inputs as &ldquo;side causes&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Side effects and causes are called complexity iceberg, as they are not visible under the water level (surface)</p>

<p>Also what a pure function is: one with no side causes or side effects; e.g., all its inputs are declared inputs (i.e., parameters) and all outputs are declared outputs (i.e., return value).</p>

<p>Explains what factors are related and not related to being a good one<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
<li>knowing that most programming problems have already been solved. You have to know where to look for the solution</li>
<li>not to be afraid to dig deep into problems: detect a problem and be eager to solve it; figure out what is wrong</li>
<li>go to the source: use the source as a fact, as analysis needs to be based on facts, not beliefs</li>
<li>just do it: to be driven to act</li>
<li>instinctively tackle problems head-on, grabbing the bull by the horns instead of waiting for it to be solved automagically; start solving the problem</li>
<li>excited about grabbing problems, about facing the cutting edge</li>
<li>taking the time to reflect and understand it before moving one to the next one</li>
<li>communicate well: succintly and eloquently expressing your thoughts. The author thinks this might be the most important aspect of all.</li>
<li>to be truly caring about what you do: not just a job, but a hobby, an interest, even a fascination; great programmers are always programming</li>
<li>thinking of programming of a way to shape the world, not just a money-making activity</li>

<h2>The future is parallel: What&rsquo;s a programmer to do?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/readings/MITApril2009Steele.pdf">these slides</a> by Guy Steele about the differences in linear vs parallel computing and about the old habits that we still have.</p>

<p>Some quotes:</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Good sequential code minimizes total number of operations.

<ul>
<li>Clever tricks to reuse previously computed results.</li>
<li>Good parallel code often performs redundant operations to reduce communication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good sequential algorithms minimize space usage.

<ul>
<li>Clever tricks to reuse storage.</li>
<li>Good parallel code often requires extra space to permit temporal decoupling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sequential idioms stress linear problem decomposition.

<ul>
<li>Process one thing at a time and accumulate results.</li>
<li>Good parallel code usually requires multiway problem decomposition and multiway aggregation of results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>A New Mindset</h3>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>DO loops are so 1950s! (Literally: Fortran is now 50 years old.)</li>
<li>So are linear linked lists! (Literally: Lisp is now 50 years old.)</li>
<li>Java-style iterators are so last millennium!</li>
<li>Even arrays are suspect!</li>
<li>As soon as you say <code>first, SUM = 0</code> you are hosed. Accumulators are BAD.</li>
<li>If you say, “process subproblems in order,” you lose.</li>
<li>The great tricks of the sequential past DON’T WORK.</li>
<li>The programming idioms that have become second nature to us as everyday tools DON’T WORK.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Parallel Future</h3>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>We need new strategies for problem decomposition.</li>
<li>Data structure design/object relationships</li>
<li>Algorithmic organization</li>
<li>Don’t split a problem into “the first” and “the rest.”</li>
<li>Do split a problem into roughly equal pieces. Then figure out how to combine general subsolutions.</li>
<li>Often this makes combining the results a bit harder.</li>
<li>We need programming languages and runtime implementations that support parallel strategies and hybrid sequential/parallel strategies.</li>
<li>We must learn to manage new space-time tradeoffs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>A program organized according to linear problem decomposition principles can be really hard to parallelize.</li>
<li>A program organized according to parallel problem decomposition principles is easily run either in parallel or sequentially, according to available resources.</li>
<li>The new strategy has costs and overheads. They will be reduced over time but will not disappear.</li>
<li>In a world of parallel computers of wildly varying sizes, this is our only hope for program portability in the future.</li>
<li>Better language design can encourage better parallel programming.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Principles Of Microservices</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://vimeo.com/131632250">this talk</a> by Sam Newman on microservices at the NDC 2015 at Oslo</p>

<p>Describes a microservice as a small, autonomous services that work together, modelled around a business domain</p>

<p>Microservices can mix technology, persistence stack, idioms, options</p>

<p>reference to the twelve factors (by heroku).</p>

<p>At a client:</p>

<blockquote><p>Design and delivery practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>standard http/rest</li>
<li>encapsulate legacy</li>
<li>eliminate integration databases</li>
<li>consolidate and cleanse data</li>
<li>published integration model</li>

<p>Principles of microservices:</p>

<ul>
<li>modelled around a business domain</li>
<li>culture of automation</li>
<li>hide implementation details</li>
<li>decentralise all the things</li>
<li>deploy independently</li>
<li>consumer first</li>
<li>isolate failure</li>
<li>highly observable</li>
</ul>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>the business domain changes more slowly. find these boundaries (reference to IDDD)</p>

<p>bounded contexts is about concepts which are shared and others who are hidden</p>

<p>consumer driven contracts as a way to express to consumer expectations, written as tests. this is a high-trust pattern (requires it). reduces end to end testing, considerably. Using tools as <a href="http://github.com/realestate">pact</a></p>

<p>parallel change for endpoints (or APIs) for avoiding lock step release (expand contract pattern). high cost to change an API: apply upfront thought to it.</p>

<p>explains about a case writing a strangler application:</p>

<li>circuit breakers</li>
<li>one thread pool per application</li>
<li>bulkhead downstream connections</li>

<h2>Why Your Company Should Have a Creed</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://ma.tt/2011/09/automattic-creed/">this essay</a> by Matt Mullenweg about the importance of having a company creed (a belief system, ethos), which ideally would be shared by the colleagues. These should be the values that help deciding, when in doubt, so everyone is aligned.</p>

<p>At Automattic, this is theirs (as of September 19th, 2011):</p>

<blockquote><p>I will never stop learning. I won’t just work on things that are assigned to me. I know there’s no such thing as a status quo. I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers. I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I’ll remember the days before I knew everything. I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation. I will communicate as much as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company. I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day. Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.</p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://aphyr.com/posts/315-call-me-maybe-rabbitmq">this article</a> by Kyle Kingsbury on using RabbitMQ as a lock service. It investigates and gives a counterexample of using it for this purpose.</p>

<p>Uses Knossos to do the testing and surfaces a problem with it. Explains specific problems on locking: at-most-once and at-least-once message delivery</p>

<h2>Broken windows theory</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">this wikipedia article</a> that talks about the broken windows theory, that states that controlling and monitoring public spaces leads to lowering the serious crimes.</p>

<p>Cites three causes for this:</p>

<ul>

<li>Social signaling and signal crime</li>
</ul>


<p>Also discusses examples in the US and in the Netherlands, as well as criticisms.</p>

<h2>The Future of the LispM</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://arrdem.com/2014/11/28/the_future_of_the_lispm/">this article</a> explaining the past and current situation in the Lisp world: from Lisp, to LispM, to the MIT and Symbolics Inc., to Clojure and Scheme.</p>

<p>Also talks about integration with the operating system and its execution in the microprocessor. Written by Reid McKenzie</p>

<h2>The Lisp Curse</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.winestockwebdesign.com/Essays/Lisp_Curse.html">this essay</a> by Rudolf Winestock, where he explains the low barrier (or low cost) for people in powerful languages (such as Lisp) to not accept the status quo in their project and fork / start their own.</p>

<p>It also compares languages and the people attracted to them. Cites Mark Tarver&rsquo;s essays several times, including the Brilliant Bipolar Mind (BBM) in <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150308085419/http://www.lambdassociates.org/blog/bipolar.htm">this other</a> essay (from WebArchive). Compares the BBM and the normal worker in usefulness to companies.</p>

<p>Cites the Pareto principle (80-20 rule): a single hacker will port 80% the library from another language, leaving it buggy, undocumented and only understandable by the original author (assuming this is only 20% of the work). The rest (e.g., documentation, bugfixing, maintenance) are dropped and never taken care of.</p>

<p>Cites that this could be somewhat based on the facility of creating new features for the language. A small effort implies small implementation time, leaving no margin for thinking it through and seeing other corner cases. Also, a single person working on the project means no code review. The style might be coherent (always the same one), but might not be idiomatic, understandable by others, maintainable, etc.</p>

<p>Closes the essay with this quote:</p>

<blockquote><p>The expressive power of Lisp has drawbacks. There is no such thing as a free lunch.</p></blockquote>

<h2>The Bipolar Lisp Programmer</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150308085419/http://www.lambdassociates.org/blog/bipolar.htm">this essay</a> by Mark Tarver on the Bipolar Lisp programmmer or the koan of Lisp.</p>

<p>It explains the history of the Brilliant Bipolar Mind (BBM) when they attend high school and college. The freedom they&rsquo;re given, exactly the same as in Lisp, as you don&rsquo;t need to mix and socialize with others to create a good-enough solution.</p>

<p>In this fashion, he says, most of the projects are 80% finished, not documented, not maintained. The same problems that worry enterprises.</p>

<p>Cites the article &ldquo;Lisp: Good News, Bad News, How to Win Big&rdquo;</p>
