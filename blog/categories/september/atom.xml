<h2>Algebraic data type</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Algebraic_data_type">this wikipedia page</a>, that explains what this is, a few examples and the theory behind it.</p>

<p>Tags: wikipedia, data-type, algebraic-data-type</p>

<h2>Recursion</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">this wikipedia page</a>, that explains the recursion basic concepts, such as:</p>

<ul>
<li>induction, coinduction</li>
<li>recursion, corecursion</li>
<li>implementation details in iterative vs recursive programs:

<ul>
<li>shortcutting recursion (i.e., arm-length&rsquo;s recursion)</li>
<li>wrapper function</li>
<li>tail-call optimization, related to tail-recursive functions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>recursion and its relation to data structures</li>
<li>base case / recursive case and removing the need of the base one in corecursion or in non-strict languages</li>
<li>types of recursion:

<ul>
<li>direct, indirect, mutual</li>
<li>generative, structural</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<h2>Anonymous function</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">this wikipedia page</a>, that describes what is a lambda expression or an anonymous function. How it can be used (e.g., currying, higher-order function, closures) and gives examples in many languages.</p>

<p>Cites its invention (Church, 1936, lambda-calculus) and its first implementation (Lisp, 1958)</p>

<p>Tags: alonzo-church, anonymous-function, lambda-expression, closure, lambda-calculus, lisp, currying, higher-order-function, wikipedia</p>

<h2>Closure</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Closure_(computer_programming)">this wikipedia page</a>, that explains the concept of closures and the usual confusion between closure and lambda. Also some applications.</p>

<p>Discusses closures as a way of deferring execution and implementing object-oriented (OO) systems</p>

<p>Tags: wikipedia, closure, object-orientation, lambda-expression</p>

<h2>Zen Story: The Master Archer</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.thedailyzen.org/2015/06/23/zen-story-the-master-archer/">this story</a> by Charlie Ambler about perfectionism and deep study, exemplified by the general that retires to study archery and the child who draws targets around the arrows.</p>

<h2>Loosely Coupled</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://blog.bwhaley.com/loosely-coupled">this article</a> by Ben Whaley about how to loosely couple services introducing a queue and the difference in patterns between push and pull communication.</p>

<h2>Being good at programming competitions correlates negatively with being good on the job</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the small video and the discussion about programmers&#8217; talent at <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/programming-competitions-work-performance/">this page</a>. By Peteris Krumins.</p>

<p>The original video explains that being good at a programming contest correlates negatively with skill at a programming job, even if the company hires them.</p>

<p>The discussion explains the analogy with height and the NBA and concludes that this parameter should be preponderated with less importance than others.</p>

<h2>On Functors</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/on-functors/">this comparison</a> by Peteris Krumins of what the functors are in different languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>C++: function objects</li>
<li>Standard ML: generic implementation of interfaces. They allow to compose structures</li>
<li>Haskell: structure containing zero or more objects that can be converted to another structure containing the other objects. It&rsquo;s an homomorphism between two categories.</li>
<li>Prolog: built-in predicate for self-inspection and the atom at the start of the structure</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recursive Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/recursive-regular-expressions/">this article</a> on recursive regular expressions by Peteris Krumins.</p>

<p>In it, he lightly describes how a regular expression relates to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">Context-Free Grammar</a> and the language support for Perl to include recursive regular expressions. Based on the examples (e.g., <code>0^n1^n</code>), it really clicked to me that this could be expressed as a recursive function, with its base case and the recursive one. Also that it &ldquo;depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">wikipedia</a>)</p>

<h2>In Functional Programming, what is a functor?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2030863/in-functional-programming-what-is-a-functor/2031421#2031421">this answer</a>, by Norman Ramsey, on what is a functor.</p>

<p>He explains in simple words what the concept is and how a type can belong to the class functor. Examples in haskell.</p>

<h2>Functors</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.clojure.net/2013/01/19/Functors/">this article</a> by Jim Duey explaining functors in Clojure. He introduces a couple of notes of Haskell but all of the examples are in Clojure. Explains functors, a subset of it called applicatives, and the two libraries he has created.</p>

<h2>10 Tips for Proper Application Logging</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.javacodegeeks.com/2011/01/10-tips-proper-application-logging.html">this article</a> by Tomasz Nurkiewicz about tips on logging:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce side effects</li>
<li>use categories and levels</li>
<li>connection with external systems</li>
<li>handling exceptions</li>
<li>automatically / manually reading logging files</li>
</ul>
