    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In bash, the usual behavior is to return the last status code:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">bash-3.1$ tr
tr: two strings must be given when translating
bash-3.1$ echo $?
1
</code></pre>

<p>But this also applies to pipes:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">bash-3.1$ tr|tee 1.txt
tr: two strings must be given when translating
bash-3.1$ echo $?
0
</code></pre>

<p>Should you want to pass the non-zero (error) status code to the next operation, use this feature toggle: <code>set -o pipefail</code></p>

<pre><code class="bash">bash-3.1$ set -o pipefail
bash-3.1$ tr|tee 1.txt
tr: two strings must be given when translating
bash-3.1$ echo $?
1
</code></pre>

<p>This might be useful if you stop on a non-zero status (<code>set -e</code>).</p>

<h2>Set Builtin Reference</h2>

<p>Reference from the <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/The-Set-Builtin.html#The-Set-Builtin">Set Builtin</a>:</p>

<h3>-e</h3>

<blockquote><p>-e</p>

<p>Exit immediately if a pipeline (see Pipelines), which may consist of a single simple command (see Simple Commands), a list (see Lists), or a compound command (see Compound Commands) returns a non-zero status. The shell does not exit if the command that fails is part of the command list immediately following a while or until keyword, part of the test in an if statement, part of any command executed in a &amp;&amp; or || list except the command following the final &amp;&amp; or ||, any command in a pipeline but the last, or if the command’s return status is being inverted with !. If a compound command other than a subshell returns a non-zero status because a command failed while -e was being ignored, the shell does not exit. A trap on ERR, if set, is executed before the shell exits.</p>

<p>This option applies to the shell environment and each subshell environment separately (see Command Execution Environment), and may cause subshells to exit before executing all the commands in the subshell.</p>

<p>If a compound command or shell function executes in a context where -e is being ignored, none of the commands executed within the compound command or function body will be affected by the -e setting, even if -e is set and a command returns a failure status. If a compound command or shell function sets -e while executing in a context where -e is ignored, that setting will not have any effect until the compound command or the command containing the function call completes.</p></blockquote>

<h3>-o pipefail</h3>

<blockquote><p>-o pipefail</p>

<p>If set, the return value of a pipeline is the value of the last (rightmost) command to exit with a non-zero status, or zero if all commands in the pipeline exit successfully. This option is disabled by default.</p></blockquote>
