<h2>An interview with Charles Wetherell</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/08/25/interview-with-charles-wetherell/">this interview</a> by Alexander Demin about the interviewee&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Etudes for Programmers&rdquo;. In it, they talk about the origin of the études, the author&rsquo;s research interests and activities. Also about the book (written in 1978) and how computer science has changed since then.</p>

<p>When asked about three things a programmer should know:</p>

<blockquote><p>Some ability to do formal mathematics. The level necessary to understand Hopcroft and Ullman combined with a little graph theory is enough. Discrete mathematics is essential; calculus is only necessary for folks working in special application areas.</p>

<p>Some ability to write clearly in their native language. Dijkstra said that if a person couldn’t write their own language, they couldn’t write a correct program. (Well, that’s what I hope Dijkstra said!). Writing programs is essentially the same as writing a non-fiction essay. If you can’t make the step-by-step connections clearly in your own language, why would we think you could in C, for example?</p>

<p>Remember that a program is primarily for communication with humans, not computers. When you write a program, the computer will do whatever you say. You must convince the humans who read the program that what you have asked the computer to do is the correct thing to do. Remember, the computer doesn’t care about correctness.</p>

<p> The answer to the last question means that programs should always have the form of paragraphs of comments that describe the intention of the program followed by paragraphs of code that implement that intention. All of the formatting should be designed to make readers as able as possible to read the code easily; the compiler doesn’t care. In particular, follow conventions of mathematics and your native language, not those you found in some random language manual. Write the comments first and then write the code, not the other way around. If you don’t know what you want to achieve and why, any code you write is, by definition, incorrect.</p></blockquote>

<p>He suggests that Scrum cannot work without the XP practices and that we need to refactor aggressively after having finished our initial design, to keep the costs down. In fact, agreeing with both parts in this discussion.</p>

<p>References one of his own videos, at Oredev'13, &ldquo;Fundamental Theorem of Agile Software Development&rdquo;, where he describes the relationship between accidental / essential complexity in the cost of a feature, attributing most of it to accidental (&lsquo;we&rsquo;re not good at our jobs&rsquo;) and describing the need for more design / refactor after the initial design.</p>

<h2>What Is Functional Programming?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://blog.jenkster.com/2015/12/what-is-functional-programming.html">this article</a> by Kris Jenkins where the author describes functional programming from an input &amp; output point of view.</p>

<p>Describes state of the system (maybe global or local) is input &amp; output of the function</p>

<p>Produced state changes are called side effects. the author calls the state inputs as &ldquo;side causes&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Side effects and causes are called complexity iceberg, as they are not visible under the water level (surface)</p>

<p>Also what a pure function is: one with no side causes or side effects; e.g., all its inputs are declared inputs (i.e., parameters) and all outputs are declared outputs (i.e., return value).</p>

<p>Explains what factors are related and not related to being a good one<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>:</p>

<ul>
<li>knowing that most programming problems have already been solved. You have to know where to look for the solution</li>
<li>not to be afraid to dig deep into problems: detect a problem and be eager to solve it; figure out what is wrong</li>
<li>go to the source: use the source as a fact, as analysis needs to be based on facts, not beliefs</li>
<li>just do it: to be driven to act</li>
<li>instinctively tackle problems head-on, grabbing the bull by the horns instead of waiting for it to be solved automagically; start solving the problem</li>
<li>excited about grabbing problems, about facing the cutting edge</li>
<li>taking the time to reflect and understand it before moving one to the next one</li>
<li>communicate well: succintly and eloquently expressing your thoughts. The author thinks this might be the most important aspect of all.</li>
<li>to be truly caring about what you do: not just a job, but a hobby, an interest, even a fascination; great programmers are always programming</li>
<li>thinking of programming of a way to shape the world, not just a money-making activity</li>

<h2>Towards an understanding of technical debt</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://medium.com/@kellan/towards-an-understanding-of-technical-debt-ae0f97cc0553">this article</a> by Kellan Elliott-McCrea about some definitions of technical debt and why taking care of it matters for the future.</p>

<p>Talks about the way of inheriting projects by other teams and the paradox of &ldquo;investing more time to fix the problem than originally invested in coding it.&rdquo; Also about judgement.</p>

<p>I find it related to the &ldquo;theory building&rdquo; by Naur.</p>

<blockquote><p>There are at least 5 distinct things we mean we say “technical debt”.</p>

<ol>
<li>Maintenance work: buying breathing room</li>
<li>Features of the codebase that resist change</li>
<li>Operability choices that resist change</li>
<li>Code choices that suck the will to live</li>
<li>Dependencies that resist upgrading</li>
</ol>

<h2>The future is parallel: What&rsquo;s a programmer to do?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://groups.csail.mit.edu/mac/users/gjs/6.945/readings/MITApril2009Steele.pdf">these slides</a> by Guy Steele about the differences in linear vs parallel computing and about the old habits that we still have.</p>

<p>Some quotes:</p>

<h3>Motivation</h3>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>Good sequential code minimizes total number of operations.

<ul>
<li>Clever tricks to reuse previously computed results.</li>
<li>Good parallel code often performs redundant operations to reduce communication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Good sequential algorithms minimize space usage.

<ul>
<li>Clever tricks to reuse storage.</li>
<li>Good parallel code often requires extra space to permit temporal decoupling.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sequential idioms stress linear problem decomposition.

<ul>
<li>Process one thing at a time and accumulate results.</li>
<li>Good parallel code usually requires multiway problem decomposition and multiway aggregation of results.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>A New Mindset</h3>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>DO loops are so 1950s! (Literally: Fortran is now 50 years old.)</li>
<li>So are linear linked lists! (Literally: Lisp is now 50 years old.)</li>
<li>Java-style iterators are so last millennium!</li>
<li>Even arrays are suspect!</li>
<li>As soon as you say <code>first, SUM = 0</code> you are hosed. Accumulators are BAD.</li>
<li>If you say, “process subproblems in order,” you lose.</li>
<li>The great tricks of the sequential past DON’T WORK.</li>
<li>The programming idioms that have become second nature to us as everyday tools DON’T WORK.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>The Parallel Future</h3>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>We need new strategies for problem decomposition.</li>
<li>Data structure design/object relationships</li>
<li>Algorithmic organization</li>
<li>Don’t split a problem into “the first” and “the rest.”</li>
<li>Do split a problem into roughly equal pieces. Then figure out how to combine general subsolutions.</li>
<li>Often this makes combining the results a bit harder.</li>
<li>We need programming languages and runtime implementations that support parallel strategies and hybrid sequential/parallel strategies.</li>
<li>We must learn to manage new space-time tradeoffs</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<h3>Conclusion</h3>

<blockquote><ul>
<li>A program organized according to linear problem decomposition principles can be really hard to parallelize.</li>
<li>A program organized according to parallel problem decomposition principles is easily run either in parallel or sequentially, according to available resources.</li>
<li>The new strategy has costs and overheads. They will be reduced over time but will not disappear.</li>
<li>In a world of parallel computers of wildly varying sizes, this is our only hope for program portability in the future.</li>
<li>Better language design can encourage better parallel programming.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Principles Of Microservices</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://vimeo.com/131632250">this talk</a> by Sam Newman on microservices at the NDC 2015 at Oslo</p>

<p>Describes a microservice as a small, autonomous services that work together, modelled around a business domain</p>

<p>Microservices can mix technology, persistence stack, idioms, options</p>

<p>reference to the twelve factors (by heroku).</p>

<p>At a client:</p>

<blockquote><p>Design and delivery practices:</p>

<ul>
<li>standard http/rest</li>
<li>encapsulate legacy</li>
<li>eliminate integration databases</li>
<li>consolidate and cleanse data</li>
<li>published integration model</li>
<li>small independent devices</li>
<li>continous deployment</li>
<li>minimal customization of COTS/SAAS</li>
</ul>


<p>Architectural principles:</p>

<ul>
<li>reduce inertia</li>
<li>eliminate accidential complexity</li>
<li>consistent interfaces and data flows</li>
<li>no silver bullets</li>
</ul>


<p>Strategic goals:</p>

<ul>
<li>enable scalable businesses</li>
<li>support entry into new markets</li>
<li>support innovation in existing markets</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>Principles of microservices:</p>

<ul>
<li>modelled around a business domain</li>
<li>culture of automation</li>
<li>hide implementation details</li>
<li>decentralise all the things</li>
<li>deploy independently</li>
<li>consumer first</li>
<li>isolate failure</li>
<li>highly observable</li>
</ul>


<h3>Notes</h3>

<p>the business domain changes more slowly. find these boundaries (reference to IDDD)</p>

<p>bounded contexts is about concepts which are shared and others who are hidden</p>

<p>consumer driven contracts as a way to express to consumer expectations, written as tests. this is a high-trust pattern (requires it). reduces end to end testing, considerably. Using tools as [pact][github.com/realestate]</p>

<p>parallel change for endpoints (or APIs) for avoiding lock step release (expand contract pattern). high cost to change an API: apply upfront thought to it.</p>

<p>explains about a case writing a strangler application:</p>

<ul>
<li>circuit breakers</li>
<li>one thread pool per application</li>
<li>bulkhead downstream connections</li>
</ul>


<p>references:</p>

<ul>
<li>the book &ldquo;Release It!&rdquo;</li>
<li>the book &ldquo;Implementing Domain-Driven Design (IDDD)&rdquo;</li>
</ul>

<h2>Why Your Company Should Have a Creed</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://ma.tt/2011/09/automattic-creed/">this essay</a> by Matt Mullenweg about the importance of having a company creed (a belief system, ethos), which ideally would be shared by the colleagues. These should be the values that help deciding, when in doubt, so everyone is aligned.</p>

<p>At Automattic, this is theirs (as of September 19th, 2011):</p>

<blockquote><p>I will never stop learning. I won’t just work on things that are assigned to me. I know there’s no such thing as a status quo. I will build our business sustainably through passionate and loyal customers. I will never pass up an opportunity to help out a colleague, and I’ll remember the days before I knew everything. I am more motivated by impact than money, and I know that Open Source is one of the most powerful ideas of our generation. I will communicate as much as possible, because it’s the oxygen of a distributed company. I am in a marathon, not a sprint, and no matter how far away the goal is, the only way to get there is by putting one foot in front of another every day. Given time, there is no problem that’s insurmountable.</p></blockquote>

<h2>Mob Programming: The Unruly Experience</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://wirfs-brock.com/blog/2015/06/05/mob-programming/">this article</a> by Rebecca Wirfs-Brock on mob programming and the experience report (+ <a href="http://www.xp2015.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/TH2.3_Wilson.pdf">slides</a>) at the company called Unruly.</p>

<p>She explains what works for them and what does not.</p>

<p>Also, she makes a difference on complex vs complicated work:</p>

<blockquote><p>complex work (where there is the potential for errors) over complicated work (where the solution is known, but is merely time consuming)</p></blockquote>

<p>Explains some characteristics of learning organizations:</p>

<blockquote><p>Teams in learning organizations perform ongoing experiments. While they settle on a core set of practices, they also try to build upon them. They keep innovating, improving, and reflecting. And how they work continues to evolve.</p></blockquote>

<p>Explains that the constant connection to social media allow us to avoid ourselves, and the connection to mindfulness.</p>

<p>On the paradox:</p>

<blockquote><p>technology-stress paradox: we share the desire for greater freedom from our devices, and yet that very freedom itself causes anxiety</p></blockquote>

<p>On the work-life balance:</p>

<blockquote><p> work-life balance [is]  [&hellip;] about noticing those moments in which you really don&rsquo;t want to deal with yourself</p></blockquote>
