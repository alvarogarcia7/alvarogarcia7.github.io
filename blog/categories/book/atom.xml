<h2>An interview with Charles Wetherell</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://demin.ws/blog/english/2012/08/25/interview-with-charles-wetherell/">this interview</a> by Alexander Demin about the interviewee&rsquo;s book &ldquo;Etudes for Programmers&rdquo;. In it, they talk about the origin of the études, the author&rsquo;s research interests and activities. Also about the book (written in 1978) and how computer science has changed since then.</p>

<p>When asked about three things a programmer should know:</p>

<blockquote><p>Some ability to do formal mathematics. The level necessary to understand Hopcroft and Ullman combined with a little graph theory is enough. Discrete mathematics is essential; calculus is only necessary for folks working in special application areas.</p>

<p>Some ability to write clearly in their native language. Dijkstra said that if a person couldn’t write their own language, they couldn’t write a correct program. (Well, that’s what I hope Dijkstra said!). Writing programs is essentially the same as writing a non-fiction essay. If you can’t make the step-by-step connections clearly in your own language, why would we think you could in C, for example?</p>

<p>Remember that a program is primarily for communication with humans, not computers. When you write a program, the computer will do whatever you say. You must convince the humans who read the program that what you have asked the computer to do is the correct thing to do. Remember, the computer doesn’t care about correctness.</p>

<p> The answer to the last question means that programs should always have the form of paragraphs of comments that describe the intention of the program followed by paragraphs of code that implement that intention. All of the formatting should be designed to make readers as able as possible to read the code easily; the compiler doesn’t care. In particular, follow conventions of mathematics and your native language, not those you found in some random language manual. Write the comments first and then write the code, not the other way around. If you don’t know what you want to achieve and why, any code you write is, by definition, incorrect.</p></blockquote>

<p>He suggests that Scrum cannot work without the XP practices and that we need to refactor aggressively after having finished our initial design, to keep the costs down. In fact, agreeing with both parts in this discussion.</p>

<p>References one of his own videos, at Oredev'13, &ldquo;Fundamental Theorem of Agile Software Development&rdquo;, where he describes the relationship between accidental / essential complexity in the cost of a feature, attributing most of it to accidental (&lsquo;we&rsquo;re not good at our jobs&rsquo;) and describing the need for more design / refactor after the initial design.</p>

<h2>Habits For Effective Refactoring</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THw8t7ePlsc">this video</a> by Jason Gorman about techniques for effective and sustainable refactoring. Among them:</p>

<ul>
<li>check the tests, the coverage to make sure that the refactored code has a good safety net</li>
<li>set a refactoring goal: decide what you want to refactor at this time and when you&rsquo;ll be done</li>
<li>know your code smells</li>
<li>only refactor on green</li>
<li>use automated refactoring steps whenever possible: for the benefits of transactionability and undo are huge and the risk of messing it up decreases</li>
<li>commit after achieving the refactoring goal: allows to create a checkpoint to revert to</li>
<li>bottle the code smells for faster/better learning (in the commit message, he uses a hashtag for searching)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Show How, Don&rsquo;t Tell What - A Management Style</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://2ndscale.com/rtomayko/2012/management-style">this article</a> by Ryan Tomayko about the management style they apply at github:</p>

<blockquote><p>instead of telling them what to do, show people how to plan, build, and ship product together.</p>

<p>I’ve never actually told anyone what to do here. In fact, I vehemently refuse to tell people what to do. Here are just a couple reasons why:</p>

<p>I don’t scale. If I tell someone what to do and they do it, then what? Do I have to tell them another thing to do? What happens when I have to decide what to do for 20 people?</p>

<p>Telling people what to do is lazy. Instead, try to convince them with argument. This is how humans interact when there’s no artificial authority structure and it works great. If you can’t convince people through argument then maybe you shouldn’t be doing it.</p></blockquote>

<p>about managers:</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s often cited that GitHub doesn’t have managers. In my opinion, a better way to describe the phenomenon would be to say that everyone at GitHub is a manager</p></blockquote>

<h2>This is why you never end up hiring good developers</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://qz.com/258066/this-is-why-you-dont-hire-good-developers/">this article</a> that explains what to look for in a strong, stronger, strongest (software) developer</p>

<p>The main idea is to find a good person that fits the job, without inflicting pain in the team morale and can learn to perform the specific tasks in the future, as (paraprasing) the pool of people that know what you need is much smaller than the people who can learn it.</p>

<p>The article specifies what to look and not look for in a candidate.</p>

<p>Some quotes:</p>

<blockquote><p>grasp of complex topics and the ability to clearly communicate about them, which are the two jobs of the working engineer.</p>

<p>track record of learning new skills and applying them successfully</p>

<p>TL;DR:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Many interview techniques test skills that are at best irrelevant to real working life;</p></li>
<li><p>you want somebody who knows enough to do the job right now;</p></li>
<li><p>or somebody smart and motivated enough that they can learn the job quickly;</p></li>
<li><p>you want somebody who keeps getting better at what they do;</p></li>
<li><p>your interview should be a collaborative conversations, not a combative interrogation;</p></li>
<li><p>you also want somebody who you will enjoy working with;</p></li>
<li><p>it’s important to separate “enjoy working with” from “enjoy hanging out with;”</p></li>
<li><p>don’t hire assholes, no matter how good they are;</p></li>
<li><p>if your team isn’t diverse, your team is worse than it needed to be;</p></li>
<li><p>accept that hiring takes a really long time and is really, really hard.</p></li>

<h2>“Wolf” narrative considered harmful (also biologically unlikely)</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://laughingmeme.org/2014/09/02/wolf-narrative-considered-harmful-also-biologically-unlikely/">this article</a> that explains what the &ldquo;lone wolf&rdquo; archetype is, among programmers, and possible outcomings for those profiles. Written by Kellan Elliott-McCrea.</p>

<p>Describes some craftsmanship ideas for these roles, based on their proficiency with their tools, that will generate tools for the rest of the team and make the rest more effective. Also discusses the non-management advancement career.</p>

<h2>Volkswagen and Cheating Software</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2015/1015.html#1">this essay</a> by Bruce Schneier on cheating software, using as an example the Volkswagen case, but especially centered on software that is made do cheat in an undetectable fashion. Or that could be attributed to a programming mistake. The later, says the author, is so common that there could be already intentional or unintentional errors hiding cheating.</p>

<p>The author cites the Internet of Things of new opportunities for companies to use / produce cheating software and about a possible solution: transparency and oversight of the software that more and more reigns our lives.</p>

<p>Other (opinion) articles I&rsquo;ve read on the issue are:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/24/opinion/volkswagen-and-the-era-of-cheating-software.html">Volkswagen and the Era of Cheating Software</a> by Zeynep Tufekci</li>

<blockquote><p>I find that several problems in Haskell can be solved by involving the type system
further: The trick is to involve the type system in ways that provide a big benefit
for the cost, but not going so far that the type system gets in the way of code
that you know &ndash;but can’t easily prove to the compiler&ndash; is safe</p></blockquote>

<h2>Hammock Driven Development</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f84n5oFoZBc">this video</a> by Rich Hickey. A few notes:</p>

<p>A: identifying a problem that we&rsquo;re trying to solve</p>

<p>D: assessing if the proposed solution solves the problem</p>

<p>the union of the features is not the purpose of the product / is not the product</p>

<p>proramming is not completing features</p>

<p>avoiding problems /= solving problems</p>

<p>book: how to solve it - G. Polya. Practices &amp; techniques for solving mathematic problems</p>

<p>How to solve the problem</p>

<ul>
<li>state the problem</li>
<li>understand the problem:

<ul>
<li>what do you know: facts, context, constraints.</li>
<li>what do you don&rsquo;t know</li>
<li>are there related problems? solutions to related problems. find an analogy: starting from scratch vs incremental step</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>be discerning</li>
<li>more input, better output:

<ul>
<li>read about your domain problem, research papers (maybe ACM)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>tradeoffs:

<ul>
<li>find at least two options (ups and downs) to compare before taking a decision</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>Focus time for programmers like alone time for kids. Hammock time is important mind&rsquo;s eye time</p>

<p>Waking mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>critical thinking</li>
<li>analysis</li>
<li>tactics</li>
<li>prone to local maxima</li>
<li>feed work to background mind</li>
<li>analyze its products</li>
</ul>


<p>Background mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>making connections</li>
<li>synthesis</li>
<li>strategy</li>
<li>abstracts, analogies</li>
<li>solves most non-trivial problems</li>
</ul>


<p>loading it: work it hard in the waking mind to be included in the background mind</p>

<p>abstraction = software strategy</p>

<p>tip: small answer is better than big answer (occam&rsquo;s razor?)​</p>

<h2>Haste: Full-Stack Haskell for Non-PhD Candidates</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3v03NFcyvzc">this talk</a> at the Strange Loop Conference 2014 about Haste language, a haskell version that compiles to javascript, therefore letting you write haskell in the browser. By Erin Swenson-Healey and James Cooper</p>

<p>In this talk they recommend the <a href="http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/lectures.html">CIS194 course</a></p>

<h2>A Year of Haskell</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZ0RQG3mFPw">this talk</a> about experiences using haskell professionally, by the American Justin Leitgeb in a Equatorian company in Quito, Stack Builders. He goes on to explain the haskell language in comparison to ruby on rails, what he mostly used with his clients.</p>

<p>Also explains what sells and doesn&rsquo;t (mostly productivity, not security) and gives pointer for applying it to a company</p>

<h2>History of Haskell: being lazy with class</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3bjXGrycMhQ">this video</a> by Simon Peyton-Jones at the &ldquo;History of Programming Languages Conference III&rdquo; which explains how the language was designed and written, a language timeline, what options they took, how they decided about monadic IO, etc.</p>

<h2>The Humble Programmer</h2>

<p>​I&rsquo;ve read [this EWD][ewd-340]​ about the necessary humbleness for being a programmer and the slow expansion of the trade, as compared to hardware engineers.</p>

<p>He cites six reasons for preferring to be a humble programmer:</p>

<ul>
<li>the programmer only needs to manage simple programs</li>
<li>simple programs imply reducing the search space</li>
<li>construct a program from a mathematical proof instead of test its properties after building the software. see quote below</li>
<li>a good abstraction can hide much complexity and difficulty</li>
<li>the importance of the used tool in the final product</li>
<li>&ldquo;the only problems we can satisfactory solve are the ones that admit a factored solution&rdquo;</li>
</ul>


<p>In this essay I&rsquo;ve found the idea of</p>

<blockquote><p>Testing shows the presence, not the absence of bugs</p></blockquote>

<p>That <a href="https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Edsger_W._Dijkstra">Wikiquote</a> attributes to an earlier paper (in 1969). In this paper, the verbatim quote is:</p>

<blockquote><p>program testing can be a very effective way to show the presence of bugs, but is hopelessly inadequate for showing their absence.</p></blockquote>

<p>This idea also connects to the &ldquo;lower bounds&rdquo; and &ldquo;upper bounds&rdquo; of program correctness expressed in the article <a href="https://cdsmith.wordpress.com/2011/01/09/an-old-article-i-wrote/">An Old Article I Wrote</a> which is about static types, by Cdsmith. Admittedly, much later, in 2008, so this idea could be inspired by the Dijkstra&rsquo;s article.</p>
