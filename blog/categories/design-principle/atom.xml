<h2>Firing people</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://zachholman.com/talk/firing-people">this article</a> by Zach Holman on firing people at your current work, both from the perspective of the employee (fired), employer, coworker.</p>

<p>Also explains his personal experience of being fired from Github.</p>

<blockquote><p>You’ll know the difference between doing far and away your best work, and doing work that is still good, but just nominally better than what you’ve been doing. Once you catch yourself adjusting to that incremental progression… maybe it’s time to leave, to change things up</p></blockquote>

<h2>Do you really get classloaders?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="http://zeroturnaround.com/rebellabs/rebel-labs-tutorial-do-you-really-get-classloaders/">this video</a> by Jevgeny Kabanov on classloaders: what they are, how they work nad some tips to solve common issues.</p>

<p>My notes:</p>

<ul>
<li>the classloading is lazy: the resources are not loaded until they are mentioned</li>
<li>every classloader has a parent</li>
<li>every class has a classloader associated with it</li>
<li>every object has a class associated with it</li>
<li>classloading delegation: the parent is consulted before loading a class. if it has it, it will load it. If not, I will delegate it</li>
</ul>


<p>There is also <a href="http://www.javaworld.com/article/2074396/core-java/javaone-2011--do-you-really-get-classloaders-.html">this article</a> on the same video</p>

<h2>7 lines of code, 3 minutes: Implement a programming language from scratch</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://matt.might.net/articles/implementing-a-programming-language/">this article</a> by Matt Might about the benefits of implementing a language (from scratch but on top of another existing language used as framework). Chooses lambda calculus as the desired DSL</p>

<h2>Turing completeness</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness">this wikipedia article</a> (both main and discussion) about this subject.</p>

<p>It has sounded strange to me the reference to S-expressions:</p>

<blockquote><p>Data languages
The notion of Turing-completeness does not apply to languages such as XML, HTML, JSON, YAML and S-expressions because they are typically used to represent structured data, not describe computation [&hellip;]</p></blockquote>

<p>If data (S-expression) is represented as the same format as code (e.g., Lisp&rsquo;s S-expression) and the latter is used to represent a computation, shouldn&rsquo;t be &ldquo;data languages that also are used as computation languages&rdquo; excluded from that list?</p>

<p>As a side note, Lisp is Turing Complete (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_completeness#Examples">Turing Complete#Examples</a>)</p>

<h2>The Prize Is Won; The Simplest Universal Turing Machine Is Proved</h2>

<h2>A low cost approach to working on side projects</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://practicingruby.com/articles/low-cost-approach-to-side-projects">this article</a> by Gregory Brown on how to apply the MVP and Lean Startup principles to side projects (a.k.a. pet projects). Try to start with a brainstorming session of all the features you want your product to have, then prioritise, picking the most important ones.</p>

<p>Most projects' needs can be solved with a minimal version, in the form of a script that took half an hour to develop.</p>

<p>In it, they describe how teams are distributed, the responsibilities for each one, and the degrees of freedom.</p>

<p>Cites the six basic characteristics:</p>

<ul>
<li>built-in instability</li>
<li>self-organizing project teams</li>
<li>overlapping development phases</li>
<li>multilearning</li>
<li>subtle control</li>
<li>organizational transfer of learning</li>
