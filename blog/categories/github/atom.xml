    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<h2>On git</h2>

<p>You can have multiple persons involved in a single git commit: an author and a committer.</p>

<p>The difference is explained by <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/repo-discuss/6aH9rH8nUdo">Manuel Doninger</a> <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:</p>

<blockquote><p>The author is the one who did the code change.
The committer is the person who committed that change to a repository.</p></blockquote>

<p>an example, by the same author:</p>

<blockquote><p>Example: I&rsquo;m not a committer in the EGit project, so i have no rights
to push directly to the EGit repository at Eclipse. But i contribute
to EGit, so my changes have the author set to my name and email. If my
change gets reviewed by the EGit team, and submitted, the committer
field contains the name and email of the person who submitted the
change</p></blockquote>

<h2>On github</h2>

<p>This is represented in github with this format:</p>

<p><img src="/blog/categories/../uploads/commit-with-two-persons.png" alt="two persons involved" /></p>

<p>One of them is &ldquo;sharplet&rdquo; and the other one is &ldquo;gfontenot&rdquo;. Both are github users that match a github-registered mail.</p>

<p>On a shallow inspection, the commit does not reveal anything special:</p>

<h2>Habits For Effective Refactoring</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=THw8t7ePlsc">this video</a> by Jason Gorman about techniques for effective and sustainable refactoring. Among them:</p>

<ul>
<li>check the tests, the coverage to make sure that the refactored code has a good safety net</li>
<li>set a refactoring goal: decide what you want to refactor at this time and when you&rsquo;ll be done</li>
<li>know your code smells</li>
<li>only refactor on green</li>
<li>use automated refactoring steps whenever possible: for the benefits of transactionability and undo are huge and the risk of messing it up decreases</li>
<li>commit after achieving the refactoring goal: allows to create a checkpoint to revert to</li>
<li>bottle the code smells for faster/better learning (in the commit message, he uses a hashtag for searching)</li>
</ul>

<h2>Show How, Don&rsquo;t Tell What - A Management Style</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://2ndscale.com/rtomayko/2012/management-style">this article</a> by Ryan Tomayko about the management style they apply at github:</p>

<blockquote><p>instead of telling them what to do, show people how to plan, build, and ship product together.</p>

<p>I’ve never actually told anyone what to do here. In fact, I vehemently refuse to tell people what to do. Here are just a couple reasons why:</p>

<p>I don’t scale. If I tell someone what to do and they do it, then what? Do I have to tell them another thing to do? What happens when I have to decide what to do for 20 people?</p>

<p>Telling people what to do is lazy. Instead, try to convince them with argument. This is how humans interact when there’s no artificial authority structure and it works great. If you can’t convince people through argument then maybe you shouldn’t be doing it.</p></blockquote>

<p>about managers:</p>

<blockquote><p>It’s often cited that GitHub doesn’t have managers. In my opinion, a better way to describe the phenomenon would be to say that everyone at GitHub is a manager</p></blockquote>

<h2>JVMLS 2015 - Compilers are Databases</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=48js0H6ooBY">this video</a> by Martin Odersky on why compilers resemble databases and explains how a functional compiler works on the inside.</p>

<p>Explains the notion of a Type, Reference, Symbol, Denotation (and Multi-Denotation) living in the Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)</p>

<p>Also explains the need for a reading compiler (e.g., for quick validation in the IDE), single-pass and multi-pass compiler.</p>

<p>They have built phases to transform the source code into bytecode, but to better use the cache locality, they programmatically mix phases using Java Reflection (metaprogramming) to traverse the tree (AST) once for these selected phases.</p>

<h2>Clojure at a Bank – Freeing the Rules</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.pitheringabout.com/?p=830">this article</a> by Jon Pither about converting OO business rules into Clojure and using the homoiconicity for increasing the power: when code is data, the rules themselves become searchable (using a search engine), visualizable and analyzable. This wasn&rsquo;t possible before when code was not data.</p>

<p>They have also build further tools to analyze rules with larger sets of data, rather than unit tests, to see if they conflict among each other.</p>

<h2>Five reasons to learn Clojure and Emacs together</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.pitheringabout.com/?p=849">this article</a> by Jon Pither advocating the learning of Clojure and Emacs at the same time. The main reasons are: liberation, change, support, simplicity, mass adoption.</p>

<p>Cites that being hard to learn a new editor is a good idea to separate those who are willing to invest the time in learning (both an editor and a new language) from those who don&rsquo;t.</p>

<h2>This is why you never end up hiring good developers</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://qz.com/258066/this-is-why-you-dont-hire-good-developers/">this article</a> that explains what to look for in a strong, stronger, strongest (software) developer</p>

<p>The main idea is to find a good person that fits the job, without inflicting pain in the team morale and can learn to perform the specific tasks in the future, as (paraprasing) the pool of people that know what you need is much smaller than the people who can learn it.</p>

<p>The article specifies what to look and not look for in a candidate.</p>

<p>Some quotes:</p>

<blockquote><p>grasp of complex topics and the ability to clearly communicate about them, which are the two jobs of the working engineer.</p>

<p>track record of learning new skills and applying them successfully</p>

<p>TL;DR:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Many interview techniques test skills that are at best irrelevant to real working life;</p></li>
<li><p>you want somebody who knows enough to do the job right now;</p></li>
<li><p>or somebody smart and motivated enough that they can learn the job quickly;</p></li>
<li><p>you want somebody who keeps getting better at what they do;</p></li>
<li><p>your interview should be a collaborative conversations, not a combative interrogation;</p></li>
<li><p>you also want somebody who you will enjoy working with;</p></li>
<li><p>it’s important to separate “enjoy working with” from “enjoy hanging out with;”</p></li>
<li><p>don’t hire assholes, no matter how good they are;</p></li>
<li><p>if your team isn’t diverse, your team is worse than it needed to be;</p></li>
<li><p>accept that hiring takes a really long time and is really, really hard.</p></li>

<h2>Volkswagen and Cheating Software</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2015/1015.html#1">this essay</a> by Bruce Schneier on cheating software, using as an example the Volkswagen case, but especially centered on software that is made do cheat in an undetectable fashion. Or that could be attributed to a programming mistake. The later, says the author, is so common that there could be already intentional or unintentional errors hiding cheating.</p>

<p>The author cites the Internet of Things of new opportunities for companies to use / produce cheating software and about a possible solution: transparency and oversight of the software that more and more reigns our lives.</p>

<p>Other (opinion) articles I&rsquo;ve read on the issue are:</p>

    <updated>2015-09-08T05:54:15+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/09/08/navigating-the-github-repositories</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve reorganized my github repositories, especially the katas and the <code>simple sessions</code>.</p>

<h2>Katas</h2>

<p>All of them can be found in <a href="https://github.com/search?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=user%3Aalvarogarcia7+kata&amp;type=Repositories&amp;ref=searchresults">this search</a></p>

<p>Separated by language:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/search?l=Java&amp;q=kata+user%3Aalvarogarcia7&amp;ref=searchresults&amp;type=Repositories&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">Java</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/search?l=Clojure&amp;q=kata+user%3Aalvarogarcia7&amp;ref=searchresults&amp;type=Repositories&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">Clojure</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/search?l=JavaScript&amp;q=kata+user%3Aalvarogarcia7&amp;ref=searchresults&amp;type=Repositories&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">Javascript</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/search?l=Haskell&amp;q=kata+user%3Aalvarogarcia7&amp;ref=searchresults&amp;type=Repositories&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">Haskell</a></li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/search?l=ruby&amp;q=kata+user%3Aalvarogarcia7&amp;ref=searchresults&amp;type=Repositories&amp;utf8=%E2%9C%93">Ruby</a></li>
</ul>


<p>To the best of my knowledge, all repositories follow a similar pattern:</p>

<ul>
<li>Contain the keyword &lsquo;kata&rsquo;</li>
<li>Contain the language</li>
<li>Contain a description of the exercise</li>
</ul>


<p>An example: <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/palindromes-searcher-kata-haskell">palindromes-searcher-kata-haskell</a></p>

<h2>Simple sessions</h2>

<p>A simple session is a lapse of time working with the language to solve a problem, but not big enough to deserve a repository of its own. Usually, the simple sessions are performed in languages that have a REPL, tool that eases this need</p>

<p>They can be found in <a href="https://github.com/search?q=user%3Aalvarogarcia7+simple-sessions">this search</a></p>
