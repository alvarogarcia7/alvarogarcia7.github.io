    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is the first post is of the <a href="/blog/categories/growing-software">growing-software series</a></p>

<p>A few weeks ago, while reading the book <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/">Growing Object-Oriented Software Guided by Tests</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/@natpryce">Nat Pryce</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/@sf105">Steve Freeman</a>, I finally understood why the software needs to be grown and not built:</p>

<p>A few days ago, I was thinking about new inspiration sources and this came to my mind:</p>

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" lang="en"><p>If we want to grow software instead of building it, should we start looking at gardening and agriculture for new inspiration? <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/goos?src=hash">#goos</a></p>&mdash; Alvaro Garcia (@alvarobiz) <a href="https://twitter.com/alvarobiz/status/581005906667687938">March 26, 2015</a></blockquote>


<p>In agriculture, at least in this latitude, there are different seasons. Different plants have different temporal schedules: you need to plant, wait for it to bloom, produce fruits then collect. Maybe remove the plant and wait for the next time slot to appear.</p>

<p>When growing software, things are different (or we think so):</p>

<ul>
<li>Do we need to plant? Yes, seed the project with resources</li>
<li>Wait for it to bloom? Yes, from an outside actor perspective, there is no result for a while, even if it is one sprint</li>
<li>Wait to produce fruits? Yes, usually some sprints past the minimum viable product (MVP) until the minimum lovable product (MLP)</li>
<li>Do we need to collect it? Yes, usually the final tests (e.g., regression) and ship it to production to be used.</li>
</ul>


<p>After all, we might say that the process is not so different in both activities. Nothing to do related to tools or materials, etc.</p>

<p>As in agriculture, seasons vary in productivity for a certain activity or crop: during the cold months, not many plants are able to produce fruits. Meanwhile, during the hot months, harvest is much higher. (This only applies to outdoors gardening.)</p>

<p>When producing software, there might be seasons too:</p>

<ul>
<li>Seasons where productivity (harvest) varies

<ul>
<li>Lowers when a new team member joins (see the Mythical Man-Month), the pressure is too high, salaries are low, &hellip;</li>
<li>Increases when there are no information silos, the bus factor is high, the team is not affected by external distractions, &hellip;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Seasons where different harvests can be planted, but a subset of them will be the most effective

<ul>
<li>A front-end developer can do back-end, but it won&rsquo;t be as productive. In this area, one can learn other disciplines and get as effective as other professionals.</li>
<li>There are many tasks to be done but the prioritized ones are more effective</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some harvests are more intense on the fields than others. After that, there is a required rest so the next season is as productive as the previous one

<ul>
<li>Some projects produce burn-out so some slack time is more productive than getting to work again.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>But there might be differences too:</p>

<ul>
<li>Geographical distribution: some crops cannot grow in certain conditions. I believe any geographic area (e.g., country) can produce any type of work (e.g., back-end, front-end, quality assurance, project management, etc)</li>
<li>Quality distribution: same as before, many crops do not grow in Iceland (due to the harsh environment) or do it with lower quality as nearer to the Equator.</li>
</ul>

<p>[Roughly translated: Concepts like allowing some time for things to grow and ripe would benefit the industry]</p>

<p>Get the tools out of the tool-shed and start buying seeds for this spring.</p>
