<blockquote><ul>
<li>a block is a top-level abstraction of a new component</li>
<li>Child items, or elements, can be placed inside and these are denoted by two underscores following the name of the block [&hellip;].
modifiers can manipulate the block so that we can theme or style that particular component without inflicting changes on a completely unrelated module. This is done by appending two hyphens to the name of the block [&hellip;].</li>
</ul>

<h2>Anonymous function</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">this wikipedia page</a>, that describes what is a lambda expression or an anonymous function. How it can be used (e.g., currying, higher-order function, closures) and gives examples in many languages.</p>

<p>Cites its invention (Church, 1936, lambda-calculus) and its first implementation (Lisp, 1958)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the small video and the discussion about programmers' talent at <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/programming-competitions-work-performance/">this page</a>. By Peteris Krumins.</p>

<p>The original video explains that being good at a programming contest correlates negatively with skill at a programming job, even if the company hires them.</p>

<p>The discussion explains the analogy with height and the NBA and concludes that this parameter should be preponderated with less importance than others.</p>

<h2>On Functors</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/on-functors/">this comparison</a> by Peteris Krumins of what the functors are in different languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>C++: function objects</li>
<li>Standard ML: generic implementation of interfaces. They allow to compose structures</li>
<li>Haskell: structure containing zero or more objects that can be converted to another structure containing the other objects. It&rsquo;s an homomorphism between two categories.</li>
<li>Prolog: built-in predicate for self-inspection and the atom at the start of the structure</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recursive Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/recursive-regular-expressions/">this article</a> on recursive regular expressions by Peteris Krumins.</p>

<p>In it, he lightly describes how a regular expression relates to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">Context-Free Grammar</a> and the language support for Perl to include recursive regular expressions. Based on the examples (e.g., <code>0^n1^n</code>), it really clicked to me that this could be expressed as a recursive function, with its base case and the recursive one. Also that it &ldquo;depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">wikipedia</a>)</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read these two parts: (<a href="http://blog.hawkhost.com/2010/06/28/tmux-the-terminal-multiplexer/">one</a>, <a href="http://blog.hawkhost.com/2010/07/02/tmux-%E2%80%93-the-terminal-multiplexer-part-2">two</a>) of an introduction guide to <code>tmux</code> (the unix terminal multiplexer) by Cody from Hawk Host.</p>

<p>In it, he explains the basics of tmux and the main differences with <code>screen</code></p>

<h2>Thermodynamics and Garbage Collection</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/ThermoGC.html">this paper</a> by Henry G. Baker that explains the analogy of the garbage collection (&ldquo;a freezer&rdquo;) and thermodynamics, where the state mutator (th program, also an oven) modifies the garbage heap and introduces / extracts entropy into the system.</p>

<p>Comparison between entropy and lack of information, using the theories from Shannon, Maxwell-Boltzmann. There&rsquo;s a reference to the knapsack problem and to simulated annealing.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a gentle introduction to thermodynamics in layman terms: heat, temperature, microstates, macrostates, reversability, etc.</p>

<p>In this paper it is also reflected (in macro vs micro states) that the sum all parts is simpler than the single ones (i.e., Information Hiding)</p>

<h2>How we ended up with microservices</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://philcalcado.com/2015/09/08/how_we_ended_up_with_microservices.html">this article</a>, by Phil Calçado, where he talks about his stay at SoundCloud:</p>

<ul>
<li>the value stream map: from X days to Y</li>
<li>reorganizing teams into service teams</li>
<li>conway&rsquo;s law and teams being responsible for support. Also, being given full authority</li>
</ul>

<h2>Lisp is still a secret weapon</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://kep.io/is-lisp-still-a-secret-weapon/">this article</a> by Judd Keppel where he explains it is a good idea that Clojure / ClojureScript continues to be a secret, not known among developers. Cites the article &lsquo;Beating the averages&rsquo; by Paul Graham and the amount of available packages in npm, maven central, etc</p>

<h2>Perceptron</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Perceptron">this wikipedia</a> article that explains the single-layer and multi-layer perceptron. First designed to be a machine (hardware), but later an algorithm for supervised machine learning. Worked by Minsky &amp; Papert and invented by Frank Rosenblatt in 1958.</p>

<h2>Give it five minutes</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes">this article</a> by Jason Fried where he explains why we should give ideas time to sink in and marinate, before dismissing them. Ideas are so fragile that it is better to let them live for a while before dismissing them. This also applies for thoughts (other people&rsquo;s or your own).</p>

<h2>Reading Clojure Stacktraces</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://blog.jayfields.com/2012/06/reading-clojure-stacktraces.html">this article</a> by Jay Fields on reading clojure stacktraces. Very similar to &ldquo;Clojure Stack Traces for the Uninitiated&rdquo;</p>

<h2>Clojure Stack Traces for the Uninitiated</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/connor-mendenhall/2014/09/12/clojure-stacktraces.html">this article</a> on how to interpret clojure stacktraces. Written by Connor Mendenhall</p>

<h2>JavaScript type inference</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found (and played) with <a href="http://www.ccs.neu.edu/home/dimvar/jstypes.html">this JavaScript type inference engine</a>. Written in Javascript (and available online). Written by Dimitrios Vardoulakis.</p>

<h2>Alternatives to boolean parameters</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://blog.8thlight.com/dariusz-pasciak/2015/05/28/alternatives-to-boolean-parameters.html">this article</a> explaining alternatives to sending a boolean parameter to decide on the contents of the function. Written by Dariusz Pasciak</p>

<p>As I heard some time ago, if a function receives a boolean to decide on what to do, it will for sure have more than one responsibility: one for the false value and one for the true value.</p>
