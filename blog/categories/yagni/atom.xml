    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/12/15/validating-data-clojure/"/>
    <updated>2015-12-15T10:52:28+00:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/12/15/validating-data-clojure</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At a client, we have CSVs of data that can be simplified to this <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>:</p>

<pre><code class="lisp">(def data [
           ["total" 6 8 13]
           ["0"     1 2 3]
           ["0"     2 0 4]
           ["0"     3 0 6]
          ])
</code></pre>

<p>In this case, some of the row named <code>total</code> is the sum of the rest of the rows, but only for some columns (second and fourth). We do not want to get rid of the columns, as they need to be printed at the end.</p>

<p>This is what we need to validate:</p>

<p><code>sum (rest [1]) = total [1]</code></p>

<p><code>sum (rest [3]) = total [3]</code></p>

<p>this could be written as a one-off program but a better alternative for us was to write a program and let users decide what columns to validate. In the future, power users will write their own validations <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>, thus creating an environment where users are no longer dependent on programmers as coupling business users to programmers does not scale.</p>

<p></p>

<h2>Implementation</h2>

<p>The full <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/clojure-simple-sessions/blob/master/test/simple/check-data-with-hofs.clj">source code is here</a></p>

<pre><code class="lisp">(defn sum-eq-total [selector dataset]
  (letfn [(total-and-rest [coll]
             [(first coll) (rest coll)])]
  (let [[total rest-dataset] (total-and-rest dataset)
        selected-total (selector total)
        selected-column (map selector rest-dataset)
        sum-of-column (reduce + selected-column)]
        (= selected-total sum-of-column))))

(defn validate-columns [indices data]
  (let [generate-selector #(fn [dataset] (nth dataset %))
         selectors (map generate-selector indices)
         check-selector #(sum-eq-total % data)]
         (map check-selector selectors)))
</code></pre>

<p>We define the domain concept of <code>selector</code> for pointing to a dataset column</p>

<pre><code class="lisp">generate-selector #(fn [dataset] (nth dataset %))
</code></pre>

<p>This expression creates selectors based on a given index. It is a lambda that returns a function, thus being a HOF</p>

<p>Users can use the application in this fashion:</p>

<pre><code class="lisp">simple.core=&gt; (validate-columns [1 3] data)
(true true)
</code></pre>

<p>The full <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/clojure-simple-sessions/blob/master/test/simple/check-data-with-hofs.clj">source code is here</a></p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Working on the REPL for this problem has been a very good idea, but working in a spreadsheet software has been even better. Even faster feedback cycle <sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>.</p>

<p>The inclusion of the HOF for validating the data has paid its cost (good RoI)</p>

<p>Do not limit what your users can do, let them decide but do not complicate things unnecessarily. Know when to stop adding features and limit work to prevent YAGNI.</p>

<p>for more information and a spike on reading CSV data in clojure, <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/clojure-simple-sessions/blob/master/src/simple/check-media-csv.clj">this spike</a> may be useful<a href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:2">
<p>for the time being, there are no power users and no need to enable these custom validators. Doing it now would be YAGNI<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>
<li id="fn:3">
<p>in the case here, the data and business rules are so simple that there is no need for this software.<a href="#fnref:3" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

<h2>Anonymous function</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anonymous_function">this wikipedia page</a>, that describes what is a lambda expression or an anonymous function. How it can be used (e.g., currying, higher-order function, closures) and gives examples in many languages.</p>

<p>Cites its invention (Church, 1936, lambda-calculus) and its first implementation (Lisp, 1958)</p>

<h2>Being good at programming competitions correlates negatively with being good on the job</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve watched the small video and the discussion about programmers' talent at <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/programming-competitions-work-performance/">this page</a>. By Peteris Krumins.</p>

<p>The original video explains that being good at a programming contest correlates negatively with skill at a programming job, even if the company hires them.</p>

<p>The discussion explains the analogy with height and the NBA and concludes that this parameter should be preponderated with less importance than others.</p>

<h2>On Functors</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/on-functors/">this comparison</a> by Peteris Krumins of what the functors are in different languages:</p>

<ul>
<li>C++: function objects</li>
<li>Standard ML: generic implementation of interfaces. They allow to compose structures</li>
<li>Haskell: structure containing zero or more objects that can be converted to another structure containing the other objects. It&rsquo;s an homomorphism between two categories.</li>
<li>Prolog: built-in predicate for self-inspection and the atom at the start of the structure</li>
</ul>

<h2>Recursive Regular Expressions</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.catonmat.net/blog/recursive-regular-expressions/">this article</a> on recursive regular expressions by Peteris Krumins.</p>

<p>In it, he lightly describes how a regular expression relates to a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Context-free_grammar">Context-Free Grammar</a> and the language support for Perl to include recursive regular expressions. Based on the examples (e.g., <code>0^n1^n</code>), it really clicked to me that this could be expressed as a recursive function, with its base case and the recursive one. Also that it &ldquo;depends on solutions to smaller instances of the same problem&rdquo; (<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recursion_(computer_science)">wikipedia</a>)</p>

<h2>In Functional Programming, what is a functor?</h2>

<h2>Functors</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.clojure.net/2013/01/19/Functors/">this article</a> by Jim Duey explaining functors in Clojure. He introduces a couple of notes of Haskell but all of the examples are in Clojure. Explains functors, a subset of it called applicatives, and the two libraries he has created.</p>

<h2>TMUX - The Terminal Multiplexer</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read these two parts: (<a href="http://blog.hawkhost.com/2010/06/28/tmux-the-terminal-multiplexer/">one</a>, <a href="http://blog.hawkhost.com/2010/07/02/tmux-%E2%80%93-the-terminal-multiplexer-part-2">two</a>) of an introduction guide to <code>tmux</code> (the unix terminal multiplexer) by Cody from Hawk Host.</p>

<p>In it, he explains the basics of tmux and the main differences with <code>screen</code></p>

<h2>Thermodynamics and Garbage Collection</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://www.pipeline.com/~hbaker1/ThermoGC.html">this paper</a> by Henry G. Baker that explains the analogy of the garbage collection (&ldquo;a freezer&rdquo;) and thermodynamics, where the state mutator (th program, also an oven) modifies the garbage heap and introduces / extracts entropy into the system.</p>

<p>Comparison between entropy and lack of information, using the theories from Shannon, Maxwell-Boltzmann. There&rsquo;s a reference to the knapsack problem and to simulated annealing.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also a gentle introduction to thermodynamics in layman terms: heat, temperature, microstates, macrostates, reversability, etc.</p>

<p>In this paper it is also reflected (in macro vs micro states) that the sum all parts is simpler than the single ones (i.e., Information Hiding)</p>

<h2>Lisp is still a secret weapon</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="http://kep.io/is-lisp-still-a-secret-weapon/">this article</a> by Judd Keppel where he explains it is a good idea that Clojure / ClojureScript continues to be a secret, not known among developers.

<p>I&rsquo;ve read <a href="https://signalvnoise.com/posts/3124-give-it-five-minutes">this article</a> by Jason Fried where he explains why we should give ideas time to sink in and marinate, before dismissing them. Ideas are so fragile that it is better to let them live for a while before dismissing them. This also applies for thoughts (other people&rsquo;s or your own).</p>

<p>As I heard some time ago, if a function receives a boolean to decide on what to do, it will for sure have more than one responsibility: one for the false value and one for the true value.</p>
