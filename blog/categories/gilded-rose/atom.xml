<h2>Formulation</h2>

<p>Hi and welcome to team Gilded Rose. As you know, we are a small inn with a prime location in a prominent city ran by a friendly innkeeper named Allison. We also buy and sell only the finest goods.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, our goods are constantly degrading in quality as they approach their sell by date. We have a system in place that updates our inventory for us. It was developed by a no-nonsense type named Leeroy, who has moved on to new adventures.</p>

<p>Your task is to rewrite the system using an old class, that already exists.
First an introduction to our system:</p>

<ul>
<li>All items have a <code>SellIn</code> value which denotes the number of days we have to sell the item</li>
<li>All items have a <code>Quality</code> value which denotes how valuable the item is</li>
<li>At the end of each day our system lowers both values for every item</li>
</ul>


<p>Pretty simple, right? Well this is where it gets interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li>Once the sell by date has passed, <code>Quality</code> degrades twice as fast</li>
<li>The <code>Quality</code> of an item is never negative</li>
<li>&ldquo;Aged Brie&rdquo; actually increases in <code>Quality</code> the older it gets</li>
<li>&ldquo;Sulfuras&rdquo;, being a legendary item, never has to be sold or decreases in <code>Quality</code></li>
<li>The <code>Quality</code> of an item is never more than 50, however &ldquo;Sulfuras&rdquo; is a legendary item and as such its <code>Quality</code> is 80 and it never alters.</li>
<li>&ldquo;Backstage passes&rdquo;, like aged brie, increases in <code>Quality</code> as it&rsquo;s <code>SellIn</code> value approaches; <code>Quality</code> increases by 2 when there are 10 days or less and by 3 when there are 5 days or less but <code>Quality</code> drops to 0 after the concert</li>
<li>&ldquo;Conjured&rdquo; items degrade in <code>Quality</code> twice as fast as normal items</li>
</ul>


<p>Your task is to create the system from scratch, with only a restriction: you must use the class <code>Item</code> that Leeroy developed. This class is:</p>

<ul>
<li>unmodifiable, if you do, a goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn&rsquo;t believe in shared code ownership. This prohibition applies to modifying it, deleting it, adding new methods, deleting methodts, changing visibility of stuff, etc</li>
<li>cannot be inherited, if you do, a goblin in the corner who will insta-rage and one-shot you as he doesn&rsquo;t believe in code inheritance</li>
</ul>


<p>The <code>Item</code> class can be found in many programming languages in <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata">Emily Bache&rsquo;s repository</a>. You are looking for the class / type <code>Item</code></p>

<p>Happy katas and happy koding. Please be careful with the goblin!</p>

<h2>How to start</h2>

<ul>
<li>Create a new repo</li>
<li>Find the class <code>Item</code> in <a href="https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata">this repo</a></li>
<li>Use TDD to develop the functionality. Remember, <code>Item</code> will stay as it is.</li>
<li>Have fun</li>
</ul>
