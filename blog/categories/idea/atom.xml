    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After reading the GOOS<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, the more and more I get this feeling of what vs how:</p>

<ul>
<li>Information hiding</li>
<li>The total simpler than the sum of the parts</li>
<li>Extracting a concept so you can think about this. Makes you find better names:

<ul>
<li>test name</li>
<li>variable name</li>
<li>method name</li>
<li>interface / protocol name</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>I also got this feeling when reading Clean Code. But with this other book the smell is much harder, stronger. This same concept is repeated all over the book. In our discussions about the book, this concept appears again and again. I&rsquo;m thinking of adding a sub-title to the book:</p>

<pre><code>Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests
What and not How
</code></pre>

<h2>Applying this in your team</h2>

<p>Now, there might be a problem if your team has a split opinion on &lsquo;what vs how&rsquo; (i.e., part of the team prefers what and another prefers how)</p>

<p>Reasons I&rsquo;ve heard to defend how:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ones cited above</li>
<li>Concision / shortness</li>
<li>Code reusability</li>
<li>Easier to test, extracting to collaborators<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>


<p>Reasons I&rsquo;ve heard to defend what:</p>

<ul>
<li>Knowing exactly what the code is doing: i.e., do not have to think what the name means and to what this corresponds</li>
</ul>

<li id="fn:2">
<p>Altough I believe you shouldn&rsquo;t do anything <em>just</em> for the purpose of tests. If it also improves your design, OK, but only for the tests, no.<a href="#fnref:2" rev="footnote">&#8617;</a></p></li>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I went to the Jason Gorman&rsquo;s TDD workshop (experience report <a href="../../../../2015/04/12/jason-gorman-tdd-intensive-workshop">here</a>), he said something interesting regarding refactor and TDD:</p>

<blockquote><p>In job offers / advertisements, TDD is much more in demand than refactor. But the latter is included in the former as an integral part.</p>

<p>Jason Gorman</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with the second thought: you cannot properly do TDD without refactoring, as it is an integral part; also the third phase.</p>

<p>For me, sometimes refactoring is the difference between code and &ldquo;Clean Code&rdquo; (as defined in the book by the same title). If I cannot find the (algorithmic) pattern for the software I&rsquo;m writing, I try to introduce scaffolds to keep investigating until I can find a viable, general solution (if the problem requires it.)</p>

<p>Even after doing the refactor <code>replace algorithm</code>, the code might not have the responsibilities in the right place, the methods might be long, value objects not extracted yet, etc. This is where further refactor is needed to introduce all those qualities in the piece of software.</p>

<p>I believe that we programmers have done a bad job of communicating with the rest of the organization what refactoring is about. It has nothing to do with beauty, style or design (in the visual sense) but is related to maintainability, coupling, defects and quality. Money, in the long run, as its objective is to make it cheaper to change in the future, a better investment and ROI. This is the common language that the rest of the company understands.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following a team member&rsquo;s recommendation, I recently started a repository to save all my useful snippets.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided that the examples should be designed guided by tests or at least to have a working example exercised by tests. Also, that I should not reinvent the wheel and use as many open source libraries as possible, reducing the amount of code I have to write myself.</p>

<p>Ideally, every snippet should be a maven project (where applicable) and be imported as a small library, therefore being able to reuse the functionality incrementally across projects.</p>

<p>For the time being, I&rsquo;m saving my snippets into a private repository and later I might decide to publish it for common usage.</p>
