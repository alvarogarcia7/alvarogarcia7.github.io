    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Some time ago, while researching types of defects and the cost of fixing them<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, I stumbled upon this:</p>

<blockquote><p>Years ago I worked with a bunch of economists in the US Federal Government - they categorized &lsquo;bugs&rsquo; in their memos into three types:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>Typos: Simple misspellings of words. Infrequent, easy to detect, easy to fix.</p></li>
<li><p>Writos: Incoherent sentences. More frequent, hard to detect, harder to fix.</p></li>
<li><p>Thinkos: Conceptually bonkers. Very frequent, subtle and hard to detect; almost impossible to fix.</p></li>
</ul>


<p>Most &lsquo;late&rsquo; bugs that I&rsquo;ve seen in software projects belong in the last category - a lack of design or the failure to make a working mock-up leads to &lsquo;thinkos&rsquo; which are only obvious when the application is nearly completed. These are expensive to fix.</p>

<p>Source: <a href="http://developers.slashdot.org/story/03/10/21/0141215/software-defects---do-late-bugs-really-cost-more">http://developers.slashdot.org/story/03/10/21/0141215/software-defects---do-late-bugs-really-cost-more</a></p></blockquote>

<p>I would also add a new category to this:</p>

<ul>
<li>Ethos: Morally wrong, although possibly legal. These may take different forms: vary from a company to the next one,
from society to society, etc. Even harder to fix than &lsquo;thinkos&rsquo;,
as there is a reason (mainly economic) to keep them in place.</li>
</ul>


<p>  On a technical note,
  these are not usually well-known artifacts in the company, therefore not everyone
  should know about them. Only a few developers know the correct reasons behind them and
  the rest might be sold a fake reason, so the latter cannot fix these &lsquo;ethos&rsquo;, as they
  assume they are present for a good reason</p>
