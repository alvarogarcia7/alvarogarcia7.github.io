    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After reading the GOOS<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, the more and more I get this feeling of what vs how:</p>

<ul>
<li>Information hiding</li>
<li>The total simpler than the sum of the parts</li>
<li>Extracting a concept so you can think about this. Makes you find better names:

<ul>
<li>test name</li>
<li>variable name</li>
<li>method name</li>
<li>interface / protocol name</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>I also got this feeling when reading Clean Code. But with this other book the smell is much harder, stronger. This same concept is repeated all over the book. In our discussions about the book, this concept appears again and again. I&rsquo;m thinking of adding a sub-title to the book:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Growing Object-Oriented Software, Guided by Tests
</span><span class='line'>What and not How</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h2>Applying this in your team</h2>

<p>Now, there might be a problem if your team has a split opinion on &lsquo;what vs how&rsquo; (i.e., part of the team prefers what and another prefers how)</p>

<p>Reasons I&rsquo;ve heard to defend how:</p>

<ul>
<li>The ones cited above</li>
<li>Concision / shortness</li>
<li>Code reusability</li>
<li>Easier to test, extracting to collaborators<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></li>
</ul>


<p>Reasons I&rsquo;ve heard to defend what:</p>

<ul>
<li>Knowing exactly what the code is doing: i.e., do not have to think what the name means and to what this corresponds</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/05/05/internal-training-testing-is-hard-just-do-it</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At a client, last week we did an internal training, in the form of a discussion about this article: <a href="http://davidsouther.com/#/posts/2013/10/30/testing-its-hard-just-do-it/">Testing is hard - just do it</a></p>

<h2>Our thoughts</h2>

<blockquote><p>When a bug is found, prove it exists with a test</p></blockquote>

<p>This immediately reduces defect rate: the same regression cannot be introduced again</p>

<blockquote><p> fix a bug a second time</p></blockquote>

<p>If fixing a bug (having defects in your code) was &lsquo;waste&rsquo;, as defined by lean methodologies, it also is wast fixing it for the following times</p>

<blockquote><p>testing requires discipline</p></blockquote>

<p>Agree. See quote by Larry Wall (this same article)</p>

<blockquote><p>[Three requirements for a good test suite]:</p>

<ol>
<li>The tests need to be easier to write</li>
<li>The test suite must run, and pass, before any code is allowed out the door</li>
<li>Support from the project&rsquo;s leadership</li>
</ol>
</blockquote>

<p>Agree.</p>

<blockquote><p>Programming is like drawing water from a well</p></blockquote>

<p>Good analogy</p>

<blockquote><p>I&rsquo;m going to assume you are smarter than me [&hellip;]</p></blockquote>

<p>This is related to &lsquo;doing clever things&rsquo;: when I write &lsquo;clever code&rsquo;, that has neither comments, nor it is massaged to be Clean Code, it will cost me many times more to modify / understand in the future vs massage it a little bit.</p>

<p>For me, an example of clever code are certain bitwise operations. Even though these operations are publicly available on websites and books, you must know about them before understanding the code.</p>

<p>Another example of clever code is taking assumptions, even if they are valid. Example: always return the second element because the first one is the header</p>

<h2>Open questions / other ideas</h2>

<ul>
<li>There are tests that are more important than others. Is there a tool to assign them weights and inform about which preponderation of the codebase is broken? The same (i.e., more importance) can happen for production code.</li>
<li>Is SCRUM apt for junior developers? In the sense of the increased autonomy, more decisions, more required technical skills / values, etc</li>
<li>We discussed what differentiates a project with a shorter deadline from one with a longer deadline. The consensus was: you should do tests for any kind of project, the shorter deadline project won&rsquo;t allow as much time for refactoring</li>
<li>Tests iff (i.e., if and only if) working code</li>
<li>Tests do not guarantee lack of defects</li>
<li>Bijectiveness between tests and features (production code)</li>
</ul>

    <updated>2015-05-04T07:43:14+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/05/04/video-nothing-is-something</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I have seen this video: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=9lv2lBq6x4A">Nothing is something</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/@sandimetz">Sandi Metz</a>, as I saw it recommended <a href="http://garajeando.blogspot.com.es/2015/04/interesting-talk-nothing-is-something.html">here</a></p>

<p>In the video, she talks programming in this fashion: (it is a stack, not an unordered list)</p>

<ul>
<li>Abstraction seeking</li>
<li>Message centric</li>
<li>Condition Averse</li>
<li>Smalltalk Infected</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>Not here to change the language but change you</p></blockquote>

<p>This is a pattern I&rsquo;ve also heard from <a href="https://twitter.com/@old_sound">Alvaro Videla</a>, where he said that other, more powerful languages can change your mind and help you bring some of those concepts to your own language. He was talking about Haskell, she, about Smalltalk.</p>

<p>She shows how to smell the <code>null object pattern</code> (that she independently discovered herself too - can be improved studying the classics<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>), also called <code>active nothing</code>. Decorates the <code>Animal</code> with a wrapper, to call it <code>GuaranteedAnimal</code></p>

<p>Later on, shows how to code an example on a &lsquo;tail&rsquo;, extending behaviour with inheritance and how to get rid of it: prefer composition versus inheritance. The importance of roles.</p>

<blockquote><p>Inheritance is for specialization, not for sharing code</p></blockquote>

<p>Steps to convert inheritance into composition:</p>

<ol>
<li> Isolate the difference</li>
<li> Name the concept</li>
<li> Define the role</li>
<li> Inject the players</li>
</ol>


<p>This is a trick I discovered here: when you don&rsquo;t know what name put here, create a spreadsheet and ask yourself what name the row should have. There is an example <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?feature=player_detailpage&amp;v=9lv2lBq6x4A#t=1959">at this minute</a></p>

    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/25/whose-fault-is-this</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the prologue of the book, while thanking everyone that has made the book possible:</p>

<blockquote><p>[&hellip;], none of the people mentioned here would be responsible for any inaccuracy that might exist in the book, as this responsibility is exclusively mine</p>

<p>Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi (translated)<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, prologue of &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Flow-The-Psychology-Optimal-Experience/dp/0061339202">Flow</a>&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>This connects with what <a href="http://twitter.com/@tastapod">Dan North</a> said in the Craft Conf about this idea of the &ldquo;I&rsquo;m the only one in the company producing good quality work, the rest are not doing the same&rdquo;. Of course, he was quoting greedy, selfish people who think this instead of attributing the success to the whole team.</p>

<p>Regarding the whole team, if I recall correctly, it was <a href="http://twitter.com/@svenpet">Sven Peters</a> who explained that &ldquo;[&hellip;] either the team wins or looses. There are no individual wins [&hellip;]&rdquo; <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>In this sense, Csikszentmihalyi assumes all responsibility when quoting and reflecting on other&rsquo;s works. It was his idea to develop on top of others, so any imperfection is his.</p>

<p>This is similar as when approving a pull request: you make sure that the code works and you stand by it. It is no longer the original owner&rsquo;s cause, but yours too, as you have signed this request. On the pull request, though, the code ownership is already distributed among the whole team, but approvals ensures the presence of the <a href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/categories/guardian-of-the-source">guardian of the source</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At the Craft Conf 2015 I saw someone with the book <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Apprenticeship-Patterns-Guidance-Aspiring-Craftsman/dp/0596518382">Apprenticeship Patterns</a> by <a href="http://twitter.com/@davehoover">Dave Hoover</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/@ade_oshineye">Adewale Oshineye</a> and asked them about the book. After praising the contents, they asked me how to approach the book.</p>

<p>I recalled reading it non-sequentially, and explained it to them:</p>

<ul>
<li>Read the introduction, preface, etc first</li>
<li>When you get to the patterns, pick one at random</li>
<li><code>10</code>: Read it and navigate through the <code>see also</code>.</li>
<li>If there are unread chapters from the <code>see also</code>, <code>goto 10</code></li>
<li>Find the remaining unread chapters and read them, try to apply the same algorithm</li>
<li>Read the appendices and finishing words</li>
</ul>


<p>Reading a connected chapter after the first one made me connect the dots and understand it much better than reading them sequentially.</p>

    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/25/demand-for-tdd-and-refactor</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>When I went to the Jason Gorman&rsquo;s TDD workshop (experience report <a href="../../../../2015/04/12/jason-gorman-tdd-intensive-workshop">here</a>), he said something interesting regarding refactor and TDD:</p>

<blockquote><p>In job offers / advertisements, TDD is much more in demand than refactor. But the latter is included in the former as an integral part.</p>

<p>Jason Gorman</p></blockquote>

<p>I agree with the second thought: you cannot properly do TDD without refactoring, as it is an integral part; also the third phase.</p>

<p>For me, sometimes refactoring is the difference between code and &ldquo;Clean Code&rdquo; (as defined in the book by the same title). If I cannot find the (algorithmic) pattern for the software I&rsquo;m writing, I try to introduce scaffolds to keep investigating until I can find a viable, general solution (if the problem requires it.)</p>

<p>Even after doing the refactor <code>replace algorithm</code>, the code might not have the responsibilities in the right place, the methods might be long, value objects not extracted yet, etc. This is where further refactor is needed to introduce all those qualities in the piece of software.</p>

<p>I believe that we programmers have done a bad job of communicating with the rest of the organization what refactoring is about. It has nothing to do with beauty, style or design (in the visual sense) but is related to maintainability, coupling, defects and quality. Money, in the long run, as its objective is to make it cheaper to change in the future, a better investment and ROI. This is the common language that the rest of the company understands.</p>

<p>I really like this definition. It is objective and measurable. But this is also a downside. Let&rsquo;s take any concurrent code, for example: you can achieve 100% coverage on a single thread and the program could have defects when executed in parallel. But this might be an outlier, as concurrency is difficult to test. Let&rsquo;s take another example.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s a imagine a non-concurrent (i.e., single thread) code composed by a single class (no collaborators; just one responsibility; it is &ldquo;Clean Code&rdquo;, as defined per R.C. Martin&rsquo;s book) that has some happy paths as well as some error-handling cases. As usual. The original code writer has decided to test only the happy paths. They deployed it to production, as the product was ready. You inherit this code.</p>

<p>After the system is deployed to production, you start receiving defect reports on the happy paths (the tested part). The first one, you cross it off as an one-time thing. Then the second and third come. You take a deeper look and start seeing some inconsistencies in the tests, some tests that actually do not test anything interesting:</p>

<ul>
<li>some test the test framework</li>
<li>some the language</li>
<li>some test a happy path that works by pure luck</li>
<li>some functionalities are tested (not all happy paths)</li>
<li>there&rsquo;s actually a defect converted into a specification (test) (??)</li>
</ul>


<p>Now, I ask myself this question: when did I start considering this code as legacy? When I saw the bug reports in production (several in a row) or when I saw the poor suite of tests?</p>

<p>I do think this codebase is legacy, no matter when I realized about it. But my first instinct would be to consider it legacy from the moment I received the bug reports, as I lost the trust in that code.</p>

<p>Because for me, <strong>legacy code is about trust, not tests</strong>. You can have tests but no trust; you can have trust but no tests (the latter is more difficult in non-trivial codebases.)</p>

<p>This is why I would like to update the definition:</p>

<blockquote><p>Legacy code is code without tests that provide trust to all your stakeholders</p></blockquote>

<p>The last part is very important, because the definition is no longer objective but depends from person to person. If the codebase doesn&rsquo;t have tests, it is definitely legacy. But even if it has them, would you consider the given example a legacy or non-legacy code?</p>

<p>These stakeholders include everyone affected or affecting the product: owners, developer team (in the scrum, wide sense), users, clients, &hellip;</p>

<p>Full disclosure: I&rsquo;ve written plenty of legacy code. Code which I thought was good but really wasn&rsquo;t. Even with tests, even with TDD, even with Clean Code. This has made me change my mind about what legacy code is all about.</p>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/21/annotations-and-aspects-in-java/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-21T07:23:23+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/21/annotations-and-aspects-in-java</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve written a sample project with an annotation and an aspect to intercept it and decorate it.</p>

<p>The code provides a way of doing <code>try|catch</code>, specifying an exception to be caught.</p>

<p>The source code is available <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/annotation-aspect-java">here</a></p>

<h2>In the process</h2>

<p>This has taken me approximately one hour to prepare the spike and half more to refactor and massage a bit.</p>

<p>If you want to see the raw details, the refactor has been committed step by step (the spike hasn&rsquo;t). The unmassaged code can be found <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/annotation-aspect-java/tree/d5e61ca56a38b1611c9acaa61a2e169b14d19d1e">here</a>. The massaged version is at the <a href="https://github.com/alvarogarcia7/annotation-aspect-java/">tip of the arrow</a></p>

<h2>More information</h2>

<p>Regarding <code>annotations</code> (like @Override):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/annotations/">This official article</a> on annotations is useful.</li>
<li><a href="http://www.vogella.com/tutorials/JavaAnnotations/article.html">This article</a> by Lars Vogel guides you step by step.</li>
<li><a href="http://tutorials.jenkov.com/java/annotations.html">This article</a> by Jakov Jenkov is very nice.</li>
<li><a href="http://crunchify.com/understanding-java-annotation-annotation-examples/">This article</a> helps you to understand what an annotation is and what to use it for.</li>
</ul>


<p>Regarding <code>aspect</code> (based on AspectJ):</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14714092/spring-3-2-aop-intercepting-methods-by-annotation">This question</a> has been my main source of information / inspiration for the spring + aspectj configuration</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>One of the drawbacks that I find to common examples or tutorials is that they&rsquo;re not complete. They show you part of the information, but not the whole. While this helps most of the readers, there are library incompatibilities, defects, specific versions, etc. This is why I like to post the whole solution, including <code>pom.xml</code> (dependencies) and tests.</p>

<p>Having less documentation for developers can be acceptable if you have tests / more tests; of course, as long as other developers can follow your thought while developing.</p>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/19/logging-is-a-feature/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-19T23:43:10+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/19/logging-is-a-feature</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>At a client, we&rsquo;re facing this challenge: we cannot access production logs, as we don&rsquo;t have access to production environments. The solution we&rsquo;ve chose is to implement the logging component as a layer on top of <a href="http://www.splunk.com/">Splunk</a>.</p>

<p>This formatter layer &ndash;per component&ndash; accesses a generic layer &ndash;for the whole company&ndash; that accesses splunk. In this manner, it is very easy to reuse the splunk connection and configuration and inject mocks. Also helps with the local environment: you always log to console (even if in production you don&rsquo;t have access to it) and can disable this in local, not needing a local splunk installation.</p>

<p>Strategies for dealing with this:</p>

<ul>
<li>functional logger: no shared state

<ul>
<li>can only log information available in this scope: parameters, attributes, static information</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>stateful logger: information is added to the threadContext and logged whenever necessary

<ul>
<li>can log information in this scope plus any of the previous invokings.</li>
<li>the problem is precisely sharing state: you have to control all the possible parents to know where this data comes from. A piece of information may come from any source.</li>
<li>Lose the reference of who is invoking you, as there is no customization for this. (only using implementation)</li>
<li>Speak two different languages: one for logging and one for business logic</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>mixed: mix and match the best of both worlds.

<ul>
<li>The problem with the shared state can be solved if no data is overwritten and any information is stored in a map where the key is the fully qualified (FQ) method name (or FQ class name + FQ method name)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<p>The GOOS book explains this very well on the 20th chapter, first half &ldquo;logging is a feature&rdquo;. If we log as described in chapters 19 and 20, some of the problems are reduced:</p>

<ul>
<li>multiple levels of abstraction</li>
<li>indirect control over logging. decide in a single place whether to log exceptions of each kind or not</li>
<li>remove &ldquo;implementation details&rdquo; such as &ldquo;log.isDebugEnabled&rdquo;</li>
<li>remove performance issues: no need to build strings for logging every time, only need to pass objects. inside the logging layer, if the logger is enabled for that level, then spend the time building strings and print them</li>
</ul>


<p>We should remember that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Whenever logging becomes useful data (for the stakeholders) it no longer is a debug information and needs to be tested (automatically). In my opinion, it is not enough to test it daily when debugging, as these stakeholders rely on the data. Also, humans are not good detecting small differences, while machines excel at it.</li>
<li>Why treat the logging feature different from any other? It is an investment, like any other, and as such should work properly</li>
</ul>

    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/17/the-guardian-of-the-source</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Overheard today at the office, while they were discussing the approval of a pull request:</p>

<blockquote><p>[Pull request reviewer] - I&rsquo;m sorry, can&rsquo;t approve this: I don&rsquo;t really agree with this design. Isn&rsquo;t there an alternative for this?</p>

<p>[Pull request author] - [redacted], of course you don&rsquo;t, you&rsquo;re the guardian of the source</p>

<p>[PR reviewer] - Well, sometimes I&rsquo;m a bit picky about introducing bad code into our codebase.</p></blockquote>

<p>This has made me think about Gandalf blocking the path of Balrog Demon, shouting &ldquo;<a href="http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/you-shall-not-pass">you shall not pass</a>&rdquo; while on top of the bridge.</p>

<p>This is part of the objectives of doing a pull request before merging code: stop the bad code<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> before it is merged to the codebase.</p>

<p>Later, as you start having <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken windows</a> in your codebase, it is easier that you start introducing more. Exactly about this is the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Broken_windows_theory">broken windows theory</a>.</p>

<p>On the other hand, if you try to block that bad code before it is merged, it is cheaper to remove it: nothing depends on it, you introduce no repetition, etc<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup></p>

<p>This also connects with the idea present in <a href="http://www.amazon.com/The-Software-Craftsman-Professionalism-Pragmatism/dp/0134052501">Software Craftsmanship, now called The Software Craftsman</a>, about preserving value for investors and treat software as an investment (with positive ROI) rather than a sunk cost.</p>

<p>It is being picky and, to the most of our possibilities, do not letting any defects nor bad code into the codebase. A hedge fund manager would not let any toxic or dubious asset into the managed funds. This would be counterproductive in the long run (maybe even in the short one) and would be not doing their job correctly. Why is it that some developers suggest or accept these toxic assets?</p>

<p>So, at least for me, would be an honor to be called the &ldquo;Guardian of the Source&rdquo; by someone I respect, as long as this is a serious proposition (i.e., not a joke of some kind).</p>

<p>the best thing about this is I can introduce the keys to the array while keeping the original map (<code>k</code>) and, when I&rsquo;m ready, to change some of the accesses to <code>k</code> to its destructured variables.</p>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/13/redesign-as-a-new-tdd-phase/"/>
    <updated>2015-04-13T22:00:45+02:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/04/13/redesign-as-a-new-tdd-phase</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>In the last TDD workshop (experience report <a href="../../../../2015/04/12/jason-gorman-tdd-intensive-workshop">here</a>), a conversation with <a href="http://twitter.com/@garymcleanhall">Gary McLean Hall</a> introduced to me this new concept of &ldquo;Redesign&rdquo; as a TDD phase.</p>

<h2>Concept</h2>

<p>As Gary introduced it to me<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup>, it is a phase that might appear after refactor.</p>

<p>It is about changing the outside design without changing the expected behavior. I thought this was also included in the refactor phase.</p>

<h2>How I do redesign</h2>

<p>I usually do this &ldquo;changing of the outside design&rdquo; by applying a series of refactors <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> to the production code but not changing the test code; using a bridge / adapter to get to the new API from the old one. Later you can inline the scaffold and use the new API directly.</p>

<p>The same for the test code: when you want to change design in the test code, do not modify production code (a.k.a. model code).</p>

<h2>Other thoughts</h2>

<p>Merriam-Webster defines &ldquo;<a href="http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/redesign">redesign</a>&rdquo; as</p>

<blockquote><p>to change the design of (something)</p></blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote><p>to revise in appearance, function, or content</p></blockquote>

<p>an example:</p>

<blockquote><p>The book&rsquo;s cover has been redesigned for the new edition.</p></blockquote>

<p>The Refactoring book (by Martin Fowler) describes &ldquo;refactoring&rdquo; as</p>

<blockquote><p>Refactoring is the process of changing a software system in such a way that it does not alter the external behavior of the code yet improves its internal structure</p></blockquote>

<p>Taken literally, the public API is not internal but external structure, so changing it, should belong to a phase that is not refactor (see definition), nor red (no failing tests), not green (making it pass). Maybe this phase is &ldquo;redesign&rdquo; or we have to take the refactoring phase less literally so it includes redesign. Any thoughts?</p>

<h2>Other references</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve searched for redesign and refactor and <a href="https://practicingruby.com/articles/refactoring-is-not-redesign">this blog post</a> came up. They cite redesign as a way of rewriting</p>

<p><a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/80758/1181094">This answer</a> and the <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/80758/1181094">original question</a> in StackOverflow is interesting</p>

<p>Redesign also appears cited in <a href="http://blog.testdouble.com/posts/2014-01-25-the-failures-of-intro-to-tdd.html">this blog post</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is an experience report on <a href="http://twitter.com/@jasongorman">Jason Gorman</a>&rsquo;s &ldquo;<a href="http://www.codemanship.co.uk/tdd.html">Test-driven development intensive workshop</a>&rdquo; on the April 11th, 2015</p>

<p>I attended this training in the <a href="http://www.grenfell-housing.co.uk/">Greenfell housing &amp; training</a> in South Wimbledon, London SW19 1JZ. The training spanned from 10:00 to 17:00 with a half an hour for lunch plus three or four 10-15 minute pauses. (7 - ,5 - 4 * 12/60 = ~5.7hours = 5 hours 45 minutes)</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>There were 23 of us, including me. We spent some half hour introducing ourselves before the training started. I remember about a tester that came to the workshop &ldquo;wanting to know more about this testing methodology&rdquo;. Jason&rsquo;s answer was priceless: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m sorry but you came to the wrong place: this is not about testing&rdquo;.</p>

<p>At 10:00 sharp, he started a set of slides explaining what TDD is about, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>productivity:

<ul>
<li>no company is willing to give you a &ldquo;get out of jail free&rdquo; card to get out of the productivity zone</li>
<li>a drop in the productivity, at least for the first weeks</li>
<li>you have to find a time slot in your schedule to practice TDD, otherwise it&rsquo;s like learning to swim while crossing the Atlantic Ocean</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>You have to feel uncomfortable not doing TDD</li>
<li>triangulation:

<ul>
<li>how each problem is different</li>
<li>you can only learn it by doing</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>TDD styles:

<ul>
<li>Chicago style by Kent Beck. Reference book would be &ldquo;<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Test-Driven-Development-By-Example/dp/0321146530">TDD by example</a>&rdquo;</li>
<li>London school or Mockist style by Steve Freeman and Nat Pryce. Reference book would be <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/">&ldquo;Growing object oriented software, guided by tests</a>&#8221;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>13 good habits for a sustainable test-driven development way</li>
<li>The basic TDD cycle:

<ul>
<li>an executable specification, encoded in a failing test</li>
<li>pass the test in the simplest way</li>
<li>refactor</li>
<li>(talking with another attendee, he described to me a new TDD phase called redesign. Maybe another post will explain this in deeper detail level)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Some ideas about <a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org/rules/simple.html">Simple design, simple development, simplicity</a> (<a href="http://www.extremeprogramming.org">XP</a>)</li>
<li>Shown a wrong example of mixing assertions (state) and verifications (interactions)</li>
<li>More than one reason to go wrong makes the code non-trivial anymore. Non-trivial code requires tests</li>
<li>You want to see the test failing for the right reason: remove / finish code that does not compile, fix null pointers, array out of bounds exceptions, etc. See it fail with &ldquo;was <X> but expected <Y>&rdquo; or &ldquo;NoInteractionException&rdquo; (hamcrest error and mockito error, respectively; both java)</li>
<li>Duplication as a sign of design smell</li>
<li>Process of generalizing code: discover the need for patterns</li>
<li>The most difficult skill in TDD is refactoring [and design; note is mine]. The TDD cycle is very easy.

<ul>
<li>TDD is much more in demand than refactoring, even though the former includes the latter</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Refactor until you&rsquo;re happy with the code, until you stand by it</li>
</ul>


<h2>CRC Cards</h2>

<p>A <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card">Class-responsibility-collaboration card</a> is as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>top: class name</li>
<li>half left: responsibilities</li>
<li>half right: collaborations</li>
</ul>


<p>Notes from the slides:</p>

<ul>
<li>each then is an outcome

<ul>
<li>do not mix outcomes and implications. An example: after winning the lottery, the money should be transferred to my bank account and I can buy a yacht. The former is an outcome (change in state) and the latter an implication (a new action that is now enabled)</li>
<li>an outcome is mapped to an assertion, while a collaboration is mapped to an interaction (verify in mockito)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Given / When / Then is not enough to implement an executable specification. We need examples, detail</li>
<li>OO: send messages to distribute responsibility.

<ul>
<li>A Then is an unique responsibility</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Topmost object: no one connects with it</li>
<li>Put the work where the data is</li>
<li>Tell, don&rsquo;t ask <sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" rel="footnote">1</a></sup> vs data driven design (tell a collaborator what to do vs ask for values and do the work yourself)</li>
<li>You want as few interactions as possible (related to the tell, don&rsquo;t ask)</li>
<li>More objects than outcomes is a bad thing (design smell) (?)</li>
<li>CRC is a very mechanical exercise, do not over think it</li>
<li>Describe outcomes as changes in OO (new, destroy, relationships, modify fields / state)</li>
<li>Continuous integration is not necessarily about shipping the code at each commit but having it shippable at each commit, as always having a product that is ready for its production phase</li>
</ul>


<h2>Exercises</h2>

<p>All exercises were done in pairs, always switching one half of the pair. He asked for someone in the pair to raise, especially if you were not a programmer (e.g., tester, manager)</p>

<h3>First exercise: Banking</h3>

<blockquote><p>Write a program that is capable of transferring money from an account to another</p></blockquote>

<p>A chance to practice arrange, act, assert</p>

<p>Later, he did it some live coding to develop the same kata, practicing &ldquo;<a href="http://www.infoq.com/presentations/TDD-as-if-You-Meant-It">TDD as if you meant it</a>&rdquo; (<a href="https://twitter.com/keithb_b">Keith Braithwaite</a>&rsquo;s original idea). We discovered together the &ldquo;primitive obsession&rdquo; and &ldquo;feature envy&rdquo; smells. We tried doing as few decisions as possible.</p>

<h3>Second exercise: Fibonacci sequence generator</h3>

<blockquote><p>Write a program that is capable of generating Fibonacci sequences, no shorter that 8 and no longer than 50</p></blockquote>

<p>A chance to practice baby steps.</p>

<p>My pair and I had the chance of discovering the importance of understanding correctly the requirements before writing a line of code. Also, I learned about the different ways of doing TDD. In this case, my pair executed the tests via a main (java class) and saw the failures on the console. When proposed to do it in the JUnit runner the IDE has, he said he preferred it in his own ways.</p>

<p>Jason did some live coding to show how he approached and triangulated this exercise.</p>

<p>I really liked some of what he said: I like to make the API correct from the first moment so I will ask questions that are correct but only check answers for things that I have already implemented. Example:</p>

<p>As the generated sequence can only have <code>8 &lt;= x &lt;= 50</code> elements, a list returning a single element would not be correct. So</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Third exercise: FizzBuzz</h3>

<blockquote><p>Write a program that is capable of returning a string with all numbers less than 100 that are using the FizzBuzz pattern. This FizzBuzz pattern converts the divisors of 3 to &lsquo;fizz&rsquo;, divisors of 5 to &lsquo;buzz&rsquo; and divisors to both to &lsquo;fizzbuzz&rsquo;</p></blockquote>

<p>I discovered that this FizzBuzz is a drinking game in the UK.</p>

<h3>Fourth exercise: CRC cards</h3>

<p>Before this exercise there was a short introduction on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Class-responsibility-collaboration_card">Class-responsibility-collaboration card</a>, explained above</p>

<p>Following an example about a movie library, there were six user stories, described at high level, without acceptance criteria.</p>

<p>We had to create an acceptance criteria for this user story. Later create a set of CRC cards and finally partially implement said feature.</p>

<p>Very interesting exercise, such a pity that there wasn&rsquo;t more time to complete this exercise or see him doing it</p>

<h2>Knowledge pearls</h2>

<p>He dropped some knowledge pearls (that I&rsquo;m going to use myself):</p>

<p>Close concepts interested in responsibilities:</p>

<ul>
<li>Conceptual diagram and class diagram</li>
<li>Instance diagram</li>
<li>Knowledge map and tag cloud</li>
</ul>


<p>Regarding legacy code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Isolate big balls of mud into parts and test these as end-to-end. Also connected to isolating groups of nodes into the class graph</li>
<li>Understand what the code does, not the architecture</li>
<li>Do not use a mock to help you test legacy code, use it just as a design tool. (It might be a good idea to use it temporarily while you refactor, but remove it afterwards)</li>
<li>Tests with mocks double down on the design: if it is broken, it will be a drag more than help</li>
</ul>


<p>Test on the boundaries. Many times we test in the middle of the algorithm but forget the boundaries, where many special cases hide</p>

<p>The GOOS book is pronounced like the goose animal (&ldquo;/gús/&rdquo;) in English</p>

<p>He said he never copy pastes <sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup>.</p>

<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<ul>
<li>This is a two day workshop condensed on a single day. It shows. In my opinion, it would be better to do fewer exercises and dig deeper in them rather than try so many approaches / exercises</li>
<li>The CRC exercise was well thought and really massaged. It touches the right spots and makes you want to learn more about the subject</li>
<li>Promiscuously pairing is always a good idea, as you don&rsquo;t know what level have your attendees. Get stuck for the whole day with someone who has a (very) different knowledge level than you might spoil the workshop</li>
<li>I don&rsquo;t see the benefit of doing the fizzbuzz kata after having done the Fibonacci sequence one</li>
<li>In my opinion, there were too many breaks. Doing a break in the morning (10-15 mins), lunch (30 mins) and afternoon (10-15 mins) is enough</li>
</ul>


<p>On a personal note:</p>

<ul>
<li>It is not enough to attend the workshop. You have to take notes and study them at home later. (Thanks <a href="http://spines.me">spines</a> for this lesson)</li>
<li>I really had a great time, learned a lot, even though I already know something about TDD</li>
<li>Met very interesting people</li>
<li>Would attend to the workshop again</li>
</ul>


<p>In general, I&rsquo;d like to thank Jason and the other attendees for making this workshop possible. I had a blast there.</p>
