    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;m currently reading the Apprenticeship patterns book, out of order (explained here: TODO).</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m writing down the read chapters in a text file, to measure progress and also be able to backtrack if necessary. This also makes reading the book a &ldquo;choose your own adventure&rdquo;</p>

<p>After reading approximately half the chapters, the navigation wasn&rsquo;t so easy using only the &ldquo;see also&rdquo; part. So I decided to break free from that constraint and start reading other chapters. But how do you know which chapters you have left to read? Knowing the whole set (<code>all</code>) and the read set (<code>read</code>) this is just the <code>all - read</code>.</p>

<p>Coming to a more practical way, how to know this is an automated (non-manual) way? There are <code>m</code> in <code>read</code> and n in <code>all</code>, where m &lt;= n.</p>

<p>The simplest approach would be:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>for each current in read:
</span><span class='line'>  remove current from all</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>as read is is no particular order, that would yield some <code>O(m*n)</code>, worst case scenario (<code>m==n</code>), <code>O(n^2)</code>.</p>

<p>That is quite expensive, especially if you have to do it manually</p>

<p>If we use the same algorithm but sort the <code>read</code> set (no longer a set, as sets have no order). Also, converting it to a <code>O(1)</code> lookup table (e.g., a map), that would yield some <code>O(n log2 n + m)</code> that is already better. Taking into account that the sorting can be automated by the computer, it would yield a &ldquo;manual O notation cost&rdquo; of <code>O(1 + m)</code>. So, relative to the amount of chapters you have read.</p>

<p>But we can even do better in terms of this &ldquo;manual big o notation&rdquo;:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>read &lt;- sort read into a map ; cost O(1)
</span><span class='line'>all &lt;- sort all into a map ; cost O(1)
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>unread &lt;- all - intersection(all, read) ; cost O(1)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>And this is where the power tools come into place: if we use <code>comm</code> or <code>diff</code>, the computer will create  the <code>unread</code> set for us, in &ldquo;manual&rdquo; cost of <code>O(1)</code></p>

<h2>Example using vim, sort and diff</h2>

<p>This is the <code>read</code> set (for the moment):</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<p>there are upper and lowercase letters. You could find a way of doing it with vi, but I prefer something that I can remember: save the document, then process it with <code>awk</code> and <code>sort</code></p>

<p>to count the number of remaining chapters:</p>

<p>The lesson learned here is to master your tools. This would have cost me a few minutes if done manually as the list was short, too much time if long (>1000 lines).</p>

<p>On a funny note, it has taken me approximately 2 min to do this processing but ~45 minutes to write this blog post. So I don&rsquo;t recommend you write as many posts as processings you do.</p>

<p>To quote Apprenticeship patterns, <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch03.html#solution_id16">A different road</a>:</p>

<blockquote><p>If you walk away from software development, you will find that the habit of rigorous thinking and automating tasks involving large volumes of data will still be useful wherever you go</p>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/02/15/open-discussion-behaviour-driven-development/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-15T02:30:38+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/02/15/open-discussion-behaviour-driven-development</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This week we had a great discussion about Behavior Driven Development (BDD). We have explained it as a way of developing software based on requirements, via automatically tested specifications. For more information, see the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behavior-driven_development">wikipedia&rsquo;s article on the subject</a></p>

<p>I forgot to mention that this is the perfect start to TDD, as this is usually called the double-loop TDD. See a post on it on <a href="http://coding-is-like-cooking.info/2013/04/outside-in-development-with-double-loop-tdd/">coding is like cooking</a></p>

<p>In this double-loop TDD, the first thing is to create a BDD scenario, run it (red-1), create a unit test that reflects this red (red-2), pass it, refactor; go to red-1 as many times as you need, doing TDD cycles. When you think the feature is done, execute the BDD scenarios and go to green (outer layer) and refactor.</p>

<h2>(Our) Common setting</h2>

<p>Going back to BDD, a common scenario would be the following:</p>

<p>Layers of software:</p>

<ul>
<li>Domain-Specific Language (DSL). See <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-specific_language">wikipedia&rsquo;s article</a></li>
<li>Test adapter: an interpreter for this DSL</li>
<li>Test software: test fixtures, methods, structures to arrange, act, and assert on the sut</li>
<li>Production software (system under test - SUT): thing being tested</li>
</ul>


<h2>A BDD test vs A TDD test</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine a BDD test for a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linked_list">linked list</a>:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>Given I have an empty list
</span><span class='line'>When I add an element
</span><span class='line'>Then I have an element on the list</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>now, the same test in TDD [using java, junit 4, hamcrest]</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='java'><span class='line'><span class="nd">@Test</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">public</span> <span class="kt">void</span> <span class="nf">add_an_element_to_an_empty_list</span><span class="o">(){</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">MyLinkedList</span> <span class="n">linkedList</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nf">MyLinkedList</span><span class="o">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">linkedList</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">add</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="s">&quot;something&quot;</span><span class="o">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">assertThat</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="n">linkedList</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="na">size</span><span class="o">(),</span> <span class="n">is</span><span class="o">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="o">));</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>In some aspects, a BDD and a TDD test are similar:</p>

<ul>
<li>the given is the arrange, i.e., the prerequisite</li>
<li>the when is the act, i.e., the command</li>
<li>the then is the assertion, i.e., the postcondition</li>
</ul>


<p>(for more information on this, see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hoare_logic">Hoare&rsquo;s triple</a>)</p>

<p>But in others, they are not. In BDD you do not specify the APIs, methods, etc. You only care about behavior.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Benefits:</p>

<ul>
<li>everyone might involved in the specification by example workshops (source: <a href="http://www.amazon.com/ATDD-Example-Test-Driven-Development-Addison-Wesley/dp/0321784154">ATDD by example</a>)</li>
<li>live specifications. managers can now understand the real state</li>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing">regression tests</a> are much cheaper (from automation)</li>
</ul>


<p>Gotchas:</p>

<ul>
<li>Test only the happy paths</li>
<li>This has a cost, do not overdo it</li>
<li>Doesn&rsquo;t remove manual tests</li>
<li>How do you manage multiple scenarios</li>
<li>How fast should it be?</li>
</ul>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We had a great conversation yesterday about code reviews.</p>

<p>The main idea was to discuss about it and share the ideas each one had. I didn&rsquo;t want it to turn into a masterclass (see the <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch02.html#the_white_belt">white belt</a>)</p>

<h2>Benefits</h2>

<p>These is the main benefits we saw in it:</p>

<ul>
<li>Increased trust</li>
<li>Learning from others, other approaches</li>
<li>Less defects, more quality</li>
<li>Increased <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bus_factor">bus factor</a> , decreased information silos</li>
<li>Also:

<ul>
<li>Getting out of your comfort zone</li>
<li>Communicating more often (code style, edge cases, complaining, etc)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Pair programming</h2>

<p>Then we discussed about the topic of code reviews and pair programming:</p>

<ul>
<li><p>How do they mix</p>

<ul>
<li>Is the need for code review reduced when doing pair programming?</li>
<li>It is cheaper to catch defects when pairing than code review (e.g., less to modify, mental caches are hot, &hellip;), so why do code reviews? <a href="https://twitter.com/jbrains">J. B. Rainsberger</a> has an <a href="http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=80ca60ec48ef77dfaa1f38943&amp;id=acc77a0fb2&amp;e=4a925444f9">article</a> about it</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Does it give you the same benefits?</p>

<ul>
<li>I argued that it does, some of my colleagues argued against as one is &ldquo;while doing&rdquo; and the other is after.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h2>Practice, Practice, Practice</h2>

<p>This is also a reference to a chapter by the same name (<a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch05.html#practice_comma_practice_comma_practice">here</a>)</p>

<p>We proposed this problem:</p>

<blockquote><p>Receive a list of numbers to a command-line (CLI) application and print their sum</p></blockquote>

<p>I wrote simple code listing and we reviewed it. The code is <a href="https://gist.github.com/alvarogarcia7/258faea12cb9375539fe">here as a gist</a></p>

<p>(Just in case, I wrote this listing with some defects / smells on purpose)</p>

<p>Here are the comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Not all parameters will be added, only the first three</li>
<li>The parameters are out of order, overcomplicating things. Is it due to something? Should I be careful about it?</li>
<li>There is duplication (i.e., parsing from string)</li>
<li>Bad naming: what is a, b, c?</li>
<li>There are no tests for it. No manual / javadoc either. Therefore, it&rsquo;s difficult to maintain</li>
<li><p>Difficult to test: a smell for bad design?</p>

<ul>
<li>How to test the adding by itself? The output is to the console, so we have to capture it (at GMaur we published this tool: <a href="https://github.com/GMaur/legacyutils">legacyUtils</a>)</li>
<li>How to test the parsing if there is no mock to be injected? Only via state tests, therefore &ldquo;end to end&rdquo; tests as it includes the adding</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><p>Mixed concerns / responsibilities. Parsing the numbers and adding them are different concerns and should not be together</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<ul>
<li>No one was against it</li>
<li>We all agreed that is important to do it even in time-constrained environments</li>
<li>It is also important to review our code reviews to make the most of it. The article by <a href="http://us2.campaign-archive2.com/?u=80ca60ec48ef77dfaa1f38943&amp;id=acc77a0fb2&amp;e=4a925444f9">J. B. Rainsberger</a> is quite useful for that</li>
<li>Even small codes can be bad and need to be reviewed (as the example)</li>
<li>Quick and dirty proof of concept do not mix well with code reviews</li>
</ul>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/02/03/pairing-with-junior-developers/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-03T23:40:21+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/02/03/pairing-with-junior-developers</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After reading <a href="https://devmynd.com/blog/2015-1-pairing-with-junior-developers">this blog post</a>, here are my thoughts:</p>

<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: the post was about how to do it, these reflections are on a more philosophical level</p>

<p>This is a controversial topic, as:</p>

<ul>
<li>You cannot discern how much or little the other person knows more than you. I cannot find the reference anymore, but it was a to the tune of &ldquo;once the other person&rsquo;s level is higher than yours, you cannot know how much&rdquo;</li>
<li>There are different knowledge areas. Yours and theirs might overlap on some areas, but not completely. So they may be experts on an area that is not useful to the technology you&rsquo;re currently using.</li>
<li>Different people have different passions and motivators.</li>
</ul>


<p>When and where are you a junior and a senior?</p>

<ul>
<li>Does it depend on each job?</li>
<li>Is it on each product you work?</li>
<li>Is it on each team?</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>&ldquo;when you join a new project you are starting from square one&rdquo;</p>

<p><cite> D. Hoover, A. Oshineye </cite> in the chapter <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch04.html#solution_id21">Sweep the floor</a>, <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/index.html">Apprenticeship patterns</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Related to the amount of senior people, is there only one senior per team?</p>

<ul>
<li>Can everybody be a senior? If we assert this is true, what about &ldquo;if everything matters, nothing matters&rdquo;. Does that mean that everyone is senior or there are different levels of seniority and we call &ldquo;the senior&rdquo; the one on the top of the list?</li>
<li>Who choses the senior within the team? Is it self-organized, self-chosen? Do the people chose one? Is a shared responsibility, as each one masters a (possibly different) subject?</li>
</ul>


<p>Food for thought.</p>

<p>What do you think about it?</p>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/02/02/book-diseno-agil-con-tdd-spanish/"/>
    <updated>2015-02-02T21:32:21+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2015/02/02/book-diseno-agil-con-tdd-spanish</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>I&rsquo;ve read this book <a href="http://www.carlosble.com/libro-tdd/">Diseño Ágil con TDD</a> (Spanish) by
<a href="https://twitter.com/carlosble">Carlos Blé</a> from cover to cover,
when previously I had only read the theoretical parts (Part I and Chapter 12 in Part II).</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s worth noting that this is the first TDD book in Spanish (I haven&rsquo;t found any book in Spanish predating this one - also backed by the author; published in January 2010) and, as such, there are some translations that could be improved. Not that it makes it more difficult to read. Sometimes it&rsquo;s a good idea to roughly translate concepts into English and then you&rsquo;ll understand the point.</p>

<h2>First part</h2>

<p>The first part is very interesting, a theoretical introduction into TDD, ATDD and Agile methodologies. Points to some good books as a reference (e.g., Growing Object Oriented Software, Guided by Tests; Working Effectively with Legacy Code; Refactoring; etc)</p>

<p>He explains the TDD algorithm (chapter 2) and the ATDD one (chapter 3). These two are maybe the two most important ones on the book. Should you read only a part of this book, I&rsquo;d recommend to read the motivational intro (the fable on the preface) and these two.</p>

<p>He gives excellent pieces of advice who, correctly applied, would set the basis for good software development, such as SOLID, Object Oriented Design (OOD), Inversion of Control (IoC), etc. (See chapter 7, &ldquo;Diseño orientado a objetos&rdquo;).</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a chapter (number 6) on &ldquo;Mocks and other test doubles&rdquo; (translation is mine)</p>

<h2>Second part</h2>

<p>The second part, as many other books where the source code is printed, was dense for me. Other books, such as <a href="http://www.growing-object-oriented-software.com/">GOOS</a>, show differences in content with bold typeface, to ease the reader&rsquo;s task.  In my opinion, it would be useful to color the diffs, show them on the left and right, or even show the raw diff (e.g., <code>+++</code> <code>---</code>). I&rsquo;m envisioning a typing program as LaTeX where you could specify a commit with its parent and a range of lines to output.</p>

<p>The second part is written in C# and python, to show a TDD session with him. Warning: it&rsquo;s much better in person than reading his book!</p>

<p>The chapter 12 is a set of antipatterns you might find after starting with TDD. Even after you keep practicing TDD for a while, you will not get rid of these smells. Highly recommended.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s also an appendix on Continuous Integration, although there are better books for this.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Recommend this book if you are starting with TDD, or you are more advanced but it&rsquo;s difficult for you to read in English.</p>

<p>Always good as a refresher to read the theoretical part and the antipatterns</p>

<p>PS: This book is free to read, published under a Creative Commons license (don&rsquo;t know exactly which one)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>After reading (in a specific order - below) part of the patterns in <a href="http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9780596518387.do">Apprenticeship Patterns</a>,
I stumbled upon the <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/ch02.html#your_first_language">&ldquo;Your First Language&rdquo;</a></p>

<p>First of all, the illustration with the baby reading a Java book is priceless.</p>

<p>Having said that, I came to the realization that you might not know a paradigm but just an implementation
(e.g., you don&rsquo;t know about Object-Oriented programming but just about Java), in the same fashion as you could not know about LISPs but only about an implementation, such as clojure.</p>

<p>Also, clicks with the idea of &ldquo;code to interfaces, not implementations&rdquo;. Does it also click with you?</p>

<p>PS: What a great book this is. I&rsquo;m reading it in one of the specified ways: pick a pattern and start navigating
through the book following the &ldquo;see also&rdquo;</p>

<p>PPS: you can read it online for free, <a href="http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001813/">here</a></p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Following a team member&rsquo;s recommendation, I recently started a repository to save all my useful snippets.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve decided that the examples should be designed guided by tests or at least to have a working example exercised by tests. Also, that I should not reinvent the wheel and use as many open source libraries as possible, reducing the amount of code I have to write myself.</p>

<p>Ideally, every snippet should be a maven project (where applicable) and be imported as a small library, therefore being able to reuse the functionality incrementally across projects.</p>

<p>For the time being, I&rsquo;m saving my snippets into a private repository and later I might decide to publish it for common usage.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Last year we started the program 12 months, 12 katas (as inspired by this <a href="https://github.com/12meses12katas">repository</a>). This year we want to propose something different: an asynchronous code jam</p>

<h2>New problem: Mini-Power Swapper</h2>

<p>This post belongs to a series: <a href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/categories/code-jam">code-jam</a></p>

<p>Each month (or so) we at GMaur will publish a new problem (and announce it on <a href="https://twitter.com/gmaurcom">twitter</a>) and post a solution to the last problem.</p>

<p>This month, the <a href="https://github.com/GMaur/code-jam-2015/tree/master/problem-01">Mini-Power Swapper</a></p>

<p>You can fork the repo, commit there and send a pull request. We&rsquo;ll review the code (if you want) and merge the solution to a branch in &ldquo;solutions/&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Happy katas and happy code jamming!</p>

<h3>My notes</h3>

<ul>
<li>deliberate vs accidental learning (around minute 19)</li>
<li><p>do not be an evangelist for tdd but rather &ldquo;come learn tdd, come at a dojo with us!&rdquo;</p></li>
<li><p>points to <a href="https://twitter.com/tastapod">Dan North</a>&rsquo;s <a href="www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPj-23z-hQA">talk</a> (at the same foo café)</p></li>
<li>points to her book - <a href="https://leanpub.com/codingdojohandbook">The Coding Dojo Handbook</a></li>
<li><p>points to <a href="http://cyber-dojo.org/">cyber dojo</a></p></li>
<li><p>design is hard whether you do TDD or not</p></li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/dhh">dhh</a>: too much focus on unit test.</li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>I thought we got rid of best practices in agile</p></blockquote>

<ul>
<li>different kinds of advice for each kind of target (eg, based on experience level)</li>
<li>points to self-testing code (by <a href="https://twitter.com/martinfowler">Martin Fowler</a>)</li>
<li>problem: the test suite is no longer in sync with the production code</li>
<li>points to approval testing:

<ul>
<li>code kata &ldquo;minesweeper&rdquo;</li>
<li>test data + code produces output data</li>
<li>I approve the data</li>
<li>Useful for full features</li>
<li>Useful for asserting on difficult parts like images</li>
<li>realistic users to generate tests</li>
<li>tool to manage these &ldquo;approval tests&rdquo;. Easy way of managing tests cases</li>
<li><a href="http://texttest.org">TextTest</a> is one of these tools</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>


<h3>Her conclusions</h3>

<ul>
<li>Watch out the fundamentalism</li>
<li>TDD might take you to too many layers of indirection</li>
<li>The share of each test (end to end, integration, unit) depends on each project / part</li>
<li>Many TDD pieces of advice is directed to novices. When you&rsquo;re not, you should know when to stop listening</li>
</ul>

<p>Altough <a href="https://twitter.com/KentBeck">Kent Beck</a> in his book Test-Driven Development by example explains in &ldquo;Part I: the money example&rdquo;<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" rel="footnote">2</a></sup> that one should</p>

<blockquote><p>quickly add a test;</p>

<p>run all the tests and see the new one fail [&hellip;]</p>

<p><cite>Kent Beck </cite></p></blockquote>

<p>Implying that the TDD cycle starts with the red. Later on he explains that the cycle continues with green and refactor and back to red.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ve been hearing for a while that there&rsquo;re some useful refactors to be done before introducing new code. Rings in my head but the only example I have is Xavi Gost&rsquo;s &ldquo;La economía del refactoring<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" rel="footnote">3</a></sup>&rdquo;</p>

<h3>Refactoring</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at the definition of refactor (found <a href="http://www.refactoring.com/">here</a>):</p>

<blockquote><p>[Refactoring] is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior.</p>

<p> <cite>Martin Fowler</cite></p></blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve found some info on <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/1355101/test-code-refactor-when-should-we-start-a-refactoring">stackoverflow</a> about the subject. The currently <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/1355782">accepted answer</a> points out some interesting comments:</p>

<ul>
<li>Do not refactor on red. Always a good reminder</li>
<li>If you are refactoring for introducing a feature, how much refactor is enough? This is speculative development, possibly taking much time from needed development</li>
</ul>


<p>The last point is the one that interests me the most:</p>

<ul>
<li>Your refactoring might not be where you&rsquo;re going to introduce new production code<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" rel="footnote">4</a></sup> (spatial caché)</li>
<li>You might end up introducing features after a few hours/days of refactoring, therefore losing focus on the refactor you did and why (local caché)</li>
<li>Given that I&rsquo;ve already &ldquo;cleaned up&rdquo; this, I could also go somewhere else (slippery slope). Heard from <a href="https://twitter.com/xav1uzz">Xavi Gost</a> at the CAS2014 at his talk <a href="http://cas2014.agile-spain.org/sessions/sesion-1h-la-economia-del-refactoring-una-vision-desde-la-gestion-economica-del-proyecto-xavier-gost/">La economía del refactoring</a></li>
</ul>


<blockquote><p>No está justificado hacer cambios fuera de la rebanada.</p></blockquote>

<p>Roughly translated to &ldquo;It&rsquo;s not justified to change outside the bread slice&rdquo;, as Xavi was referring to software as sliced bread instead of layers, vertical rather than horizontal</p>

<h3>Should you do it?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Doing it would be a good thing, as long as you know in advance what will be affected by the next feature.</li>
<li>It can allow for less refactoring at the end of the cycle. This is not about duplication but refactoring to patterns. There might be a gain in refactoring to a pattern before introducing another feature. An example might be adding a new strategy when it&rsquo;s currently coded as if-then-else</li>
<li>The last responsible moment might be before or after introducing the feature. You decide.</li>
<li>Work less as there&rsquo;s no need for adding new cases to old structures and then simplifying</li>
</ul>


<h3>Should you not do it?</h3>

<ul>
<li>Foreseeing the future is difficult, therefore you might end with unused development, as it is speculating</li>
<li>Related to the last point, you might end refactoring in the wrong places. There&rsquo;s no current business value to it.</li>
<li>Not useful on first round of a new feature, you can use a lambda transition to the red again. But then, this is not a general pattern, only applicable to a big percent of cases.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusions</h2>

<p>Short answer: it mainly depends on your environment:</p>

<ul>
<li>You: experience, common sense (sadly) &mdash;another post coming&mdash;, benefit/time-wasted ratio</li>
<li>Your project: how tight are deadlines, how critical that code is, the team&rsquo;s pressure</li>
</ul>


<p>Long answer: Yes, as long as:
 1. You realize there is a fine line between fixing code and rewriting code (Egoless programming #4). Don&rsquo;t be a lone enforcer
 2. Strictly follow the boy scout rule but only around your campfire, not outside of it.
 1. You know your domain, pitfalls and team well
 1. You want to test this hypothesis and post an answer</p>

    <link href="http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2014/12/18/global-day-of-code-retreat/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-18T07:33:59+01:00</updated>
    <id>http://alvarogarcia7.github.io/blog/2014/12/18/global-day-of-code-retreat</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>One month ago (on November 15th) I facilitated my first <a href="http://globalday.coderetreat.org/">Global Day of Code Retreat</a> at <a href="http://www.ebayenterprise.com/contact/locations.php">eBay Enterprise International</a> and had such a blast. <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Barcelona-Meetup/events/218211672/">Link to the event (Spanish)</a></p>

<h2>Some thoughts</h2>

<p>After a month of thinking about it, here are some thoughts:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>This year&rsquo;s GDCR was quite different that last one&rsquo;s:</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s OK: do not strive for repeating the same each year</p></li>
<li><p>Heat map (in several dimensions): TDD x language</p>

<p>Usually meetups have a clear goal, for the limited amount of time they run (see another bullet point).</p>

<p>This single goal can span across multiple skill sets (e.g., TDD and language specific), therefore we did a two-dimensional heat map: first dimension is TDD skill level and second dimension (discreet) would be language you master</p>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1LRmjLbvFEtqDskDwb3gVBKDfXckqDylAMJA7HB6ZLC8/edit">Example can be found here</a></p></li>
<li><p>As a facilitator, have a clear goal for the meetup, even though you don&rsquo;t need to share it with the assistants</p>

<p>Mine was to have fun and introduce some people to TDD</p>

<p>I shared the goal with the attendants because I wanted to explain the purpose of that day to newcomers.</p>

<p>Also, as a result of that day, I&rsquo;ve discovered some very motivated people in our host (eBay). Personally, I&rsquo;d like to continue doing meetups with their developers.</p></li>
<li><p>You need a mix of more seasoned attendants and more unexperienced ones.</p>

<p>This way, the knowledge is being transferred both ways; not only about the language but about strategies, patterns, shortcuts &amp; editors, languages, etc</p>

<p>If doing TDD in these events, it&rsquo;s even more important to mix people, as it&rsquo;s difficult for an unexperienced pair to start doing TDD for themselves.</p></li>
<li><p>You should only do your job as facilitator</p>

<p>Let others discuss, ask and answer questions. Your job should be as thin as possible. Don&rsquo;t try to answer too many questions</p>

<p>There will be attendants with more experience / expertise than you (most of them were in my case), so don&rsquo;t strive to teach them but to manage the discussions to the right place</p>

<p>Be strict about timing but find the balance. Sometimes it&rsquo;s useful to invest more time (~5 minutes) to a rich discussion and then reduce the next iteration.</p>

<p>Many people will complain about having to delete their code the first time. Explain to them that&rsquo;s part of the game and don&rsquo;t give in. The following iterations most of the people won&rsquo;t complain anymore</p>

<p>Last but not least, have fun!</p></li>
</ol>


<h2>Some critiques</h2>

<p>We organized the event a little bit late</p>

<ul>
<li><p>The difference from last year (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Barcelona-Meetup/events/153967432/">December</a>) vs this year (<a href="http://www.meetup.com/Agile-Barcelona-Meetup/events/218211672/">November</a>) was relevant. We were expecting to do it later so it surprised us.</p></li>
<li><p>Due to that, many people couldn&rsquo;t come and I&rsquo;m sorry for it</p></li>
</ul>


<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>We totally, definitely should do this more often.</p>

<p>You need to reinvent yourself for every global day or people will stop coming</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Quoting the book,</p>

<blockquote><p>Why is programming fun? What delights may its practitioner expect as his reward?</p>

<p>First is the sheer joy of making things. As the child delights in his mud pie, so the adult enjoys building things, especially things of his own design [&hellip;]</p>

<p>Second is the pleasure of making things that are useful to other people. Deep within, we want other to use our work and to find it helpful. [&hellip;]</p>

<p>Third is the fascination of fashioning complex puzzle-like objects of interlocking moving parts and watching them work in subtle cycles, playing out the consequences of principles built in from the beginning. [&hellip;]</p>

<p>Fourth is the joy of always learning, which springs from the nonrepeating nature of the task. In one way or another the problem is ever new, and its solver learns something: sometimes practical, sometimes theoretical, and sometimes both.</p>

<p>Finally, there is the delight of working in such a tractable medium. The programmer, like the poet, works only slightly removed from the pure thought-stuff. He builds his castles in the air, from air, creating by exertion of the imagination. Few media of creating are so flexible, so easy to polish and rework, so readily capable of realizing grand conceptual structures. (As we shall see later, this very tractability has its own problems.)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This is a free application I use quite often: <a href="http://getpocket.com/">pocket</a></p>

<p>They promote it as &ldquo;When you find something you want to view later, put it in Pocket.&rdquo;</p>

<p>I really use for that. Once you install it in your phone, some handy shortcuts appear both on Chrome for saving the page and on twitter when you hit the &ldquo;share&rdquo; button.</p>

<p>It is especially useful when you&rsquo;re on the tube and have no connection, as pocket saves an offline version of the page (warning: this doesn&rsquo;t work for video sites like youtube)</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>This year&rsquo;s edition of the CAS 2014 has been awesome. There were several tracks:</p>

<ul>
<li>Enterprise Agile</li>
<li>Collaboration, Culture and Teams</li>
<li>Delighting Products</li>
<li>Agile+</li>
<li>Development Practices and Craftsmanship</li>
</ul>


<p>The last one is where I spent most of the time.</p>

<h2>The schedule</h2>

<p> The first day:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/sandromancuso">Sandro Mancuso</a>: talking about Software Craftsmanship</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/fiunchinho">Jose Manuel Armesto</a>: talking about Unit Testing sucks (and it&rsquo;s our fault)</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/rmarpozo">Rubén Martín Pozo</a>: talking about Specification by example - Historia de un equipo que no odia documentar</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/XaV1uzz">Xavi Gost</a>: talking about La economía del refactoring. Una visión desde la gestión económica del proyecto.</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/_pedro_torres">Pedro Gustavo Torres</a>: talking about Pair Programming</li>
</ul>


<p> The second day:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/rafadc">Rafael de Castro</a>: talking about Generando tests</li>
<li><a href="https://twitter.com/borillo">Ricardo Borillo</a>: talking about CQRS y los beneficios surgidos de la necesidad.</li>

</ul>


<h2> Some thoughts</h2>

<p> The conferences were awesome, but I&rsquo;d preferred if most (if not all) were in English so this conference can attract more international speakers</p>

<p> There were 600+ people in the <a href="http://www.cccb.org/">CCCB</a>. That was only possible due to all the volunteers, organizers, caterers and the assistants.</p>

<h2> More info</h2>

<p> You can find more information on the <a href="http://cas2014.agile-spain.org/">official website</a> and on twitter using the hashtag <a href="https://twitter.com/search?q=%23cas2k14&amp;src=tyah">#cas2014</a></p>
